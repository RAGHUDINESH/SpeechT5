mr president ~ first ] of all i would like to thank all members of the ` raffle decision based condition ] put on the base for their international commission
i look forward to continuing to work with you on their foresharing proposal and bringing it to a successful conclusion with your support
we all agree in the last session in the strasbourg that development is important but we need to remember it now when we are talking about the financial contributions
we need to invest in introduce neighbours of development and yes most of all we need to invest in good governance
they are ready to give ! thousands ] of euros to traffickers because there is not good governance
migrants are not even extremely poor but they are all extremely desperate
if we get back for example to the issue of migration we will see that this is the key question of governance
forward to war but also the lack of freedom and bad governance is what makes desperate people to undertake dangerous journeys in the search for a better life in * europe ] and development cooperation is part of the answer to this challenge
in all these efforts ahead of the ~ third ] international conference in % artice aberba ] we need to be aware of the finance alone will not be sufficient policies are of fundamental importance in achieving sustainable development goals we need policies that will ensure that financial resources are used effectively and in areas that will bring to further mobilisation of resources unsustainable development
furthermore we need a completely new approach to financing development
the ~ first ] regulative act which will provide police in all member states with their commercials
i suppose and i am sure that the end of this commission is not beginning a discussion because it is really very complicated package and i do not think that all of how members are ready to full package
we have to be ready for that
it does not mean that we have to be technologically ahead of technology we have to be very firm and argue principle ground it is the fundamental rights of people to be people people people people people first at technology for people
the economy technology is ahead of us
was ! one ] of the regions that brought us to the financial crisis
could we do more and could you perhaps be more specific what has done so far and what are you aiming
mr president i also want to raise the issue of respect of religious freedom of foreign without discrimination because this is a massive
efsi also concludes to the account of ! twenty one ] objectives to keep a stable development and environment objectives in mind efsi also increases the local presence level through the reinforcing of the ` european investment basic rehapt ]
we all know that some member states will do their best to weaken this legislation
we took many measures to improve the situation and i believe we reach certain improvement
with climate change bringing more extreme waste events we need to be able to protect human lifes and valuable assets and make our regions our cities and our targets more resilient
as for energy @ three years ago ] the ` eu had survey ] government decided to set current * eu ] to sovereignty opportunities as a clear deadline for the completion of internal energy market
well orders on tackle the commission action plans have been published and adopted
it also says clearly that it urgests the member states which are absent here not to impose any obligation on incryption providers that would result in the weakening or composing of the security of their networks or devices such as the creator a creation of facilitation of back doors
for the % eu ] the immediate challenge is to help ensure a fair and inclusive electoral process and be prepared for a range of single areas
but we should not lose sight of the big picture
the ) irish ] system works within a legal and regulatory policy directive framework dictated by the % eu ]
% ireland ] is no worse or no better than any other place but i object to hostile commons about % ireland ] eminating from % london new york ] and the ) german ] media
all these places have experienced regularly and banking challenges and problems equal to and in many cases far worse than what we have faced in % ireland ]
the ` constant ] sniping from some of our % eu ] neighbours has been based on prejudice rather than objective fact and those little for the % eu ] solidarity at a time when * europe ] is going through enormous financial and economic challenges
much for the question
raising funds for research and care addressing discrimination at work and advocating for policy change with decision makers all depend on previous awareness and understanding of multiple skillosus
our choice tomorrow is to go for a strong mandate with a bun and go for negotiations or go for negotiations using as a starting point on mandate and end up with something meaningless
in exchange we go the protection of the vulnerable marine cosystems
mr president @ one month ] after we voted our compromise the ` council ] did not put it on the agenda did not even present it i use this time to talk with the member states and the presidency
if this compromise is further what it done it will become meaningless
if you want to change the rules in ` parliament ] of ` parliament ] of the ` balance of the council ] you have to change it ~ first ] in the ` council ] and then we will see finally as you say fully understand the position of the ` council ] in the ` space ] and ` candidate ] issue but they also have to approve
the ` council ] rate we have to approve its programme and we have to approve the college
finally you have been in the % us ] @ last week ] and finally you have been in the % us ] @ last week ] i hope you have been in the % us ] @ last week ] and finally you have been in the % us ] @ last week ] i hope you have been in the % us ] @ last week ] and finally you have been in the % us ] @ last week ] i hope you have had interesting meetings
we new have a date to give us @ today ] on the shopping and interest case
in this report we strongly support the independence of the commission and the national commitment in authorities
what with the commissioner 's among the work with commissioner } amonia ] in
as you know this is a non binding report but it sends a strong political message to the commission
@ two thousand and thirteen ] this may be the last competition report of this term @ next year ] we have ) european ] actions again
yet the importance of our ` parliament ] ship with the ` eib ] and with the ` european union ] in meeting our commitments both to our shaft orders and to our countries of operations is clearer than ever
~ second ] under the aggress of the % european union ] new structures of cooperation between ` ebrd ] and ` eib ] offer great new opportunities for us to work together
these initiatives facilitated by ec funds bring us together to work concretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and as such offer an excellent crucible in which to forge the development of our joint work
we have this wide range of stakeholders we are working together to implement the plan and are developing the coordination and cooperation mechanisms to do so and we see as we saw last organised when faced with a conflict driven banking crisis in % jorda ]
~ third ] i take the ` european parliament ] 's views as welcome in put to the early stages of the ` ebrd ] forthcapital resources review which we will conclude at our annual meeting in % zabrab ] and % may ]
faced with the dramatic decline and private flows of credit we came together @ last month ] with the ` world bank group ] to launch the joint ` irish ] action plan and support of banking systems and lending to the real economy in central and eastern * europe ]
an increase of more
~ first ] the context of the financial and economic crisis renders any encouragement of greater cooperation between ` ebrd ] and ` eib ] more relevant than ever
at the same time we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is all so increasing
@ two thousand and ten ] the ` eib ] has taken a pro active stance in response to the crisis supporting our clients and countries of operations we are expanding our instruments and aiming to invest ( eur seven billion ] in @ two thousand and nine ] ! ten ] the ` eib ] has taken our active stands in response to the crisis supporting our clients and countries of operations we are expanding our instruments and investing
yet the crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy driven respiration but a vital necessity
the full implications of the current situation on our portfolio and the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen
i believe it is in this context that we may find devisions of labour applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation including common standards which you have called for
that this kind of our vice cooperation born of need is the kind that we expressed
i refer in particular to the * western bulgarian ] 's investment framework now being launched as well as the ` chroze ] ` eastern partnership ] announced by the ` european council ] in @ recent days ] which will build on the good cooperation we have already established through our memorandum of understanding and the neighbourhood investment facility
the action plan recognises that an effective crisis response in * europe ] 's integrated financial markets requires fast and coordinated action by all stakeholders parent banks which own a large part of the region 's financial sectors
mr president what worries me most is the suggestion that the ` european investment bank ] has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis that it can somehow act as the ) europe ] wide body to provide stimulate where member states are single to coordinate their own stimulate
i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks
the ` eib ] has a liverage of about ! thirty five ] times and its shareholders are member state governments
it would be a serious issue if it were to go bast like some of our commercial banks the report even encourages the ` eib ] and the commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments
the danger is that if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments as has been suggested that its enviable high credit rate may be down graded like some of our governments
however i would stress that the commission has neither the capacity nor the desire to lead the delivery of the action plan itself
the implementation of the action plan will require real cooperation commitment and leadership from member states and regional stakeholders to the leader the attitude or so projects included at this stage
this rapid progress is important if we are to maintain momentum as we answer the implementation face of the strategy
this is the only way to ensure that the ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the member states and other stateholders
the commission very much expects ` parliament ] to be actively involved in events such as the annual forum
the ~ first ] formal assessment of progress made will be presented under the & polish ] presidency in the @ second half of two thousand and twenty ]
this will give all stakeholders an opportunity to consider how the ~ first ] months of the strategy have gone and what lessons might be drawn already at that stage
that coordination monitoring and reporting is done by the commission and the implementation on the ground is led by the member states or the organisations of the ` boltic syrian ]
i would now like to say a fewer words about the planned governance system which is proposed for the operational implementation of the strategy
this is ! one ] area wherever there has been much discussion among the member states but the overall approach is that policy orientations will be taken by the ` council ]
the bottom system strategy has equired a completely new approach for the commission as it is the ~ first ] time we have prepared an integrated strategy for a group of member states who have to face the same challenges and who may benefit from the same opportunities
in financial terms although there is no disciplination from the ` eu ] budget the strategy proposes a more coordinated use of existing funds and a more imaginative approach to other funding sources such as the ` european investment bank ] or the % norwich investment bank ]
of course it is not a complete surprise to me that ` parliament ] is taking such an interest in the strategy
@ next year ]
i would like to conclude by saying that i look forward to continuing to work closely with the ` european parliament ] on all objects of this protection
the ) swedish ] presidency has led positive and constructive discussions in the ` council ] which are to lead to conclusions in @ october ]
here we expect to see a wave of coordination meetings to keep start the various priority areas and individual projects included in the action plan
responsibility must rest with the relevant member states and other stateholders directly involved on the ground
your begging is crucial to maintain ways to red visibility for strategy to maintain highlevel level political support for strategy and to maintain pressure on the member states and the regional actors to deliver results
in addition the commission proposals to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties
i would like to underline this point as it must be clear that all our preparator work on the strategic framework that i have just excrising will count for not unless we start to deliver genuine visible concrete results on the ground hence the importance of a strategic action plan which has also been drawn up during the preparatory work
the population of * europe ]
the majority are fed up with mess migration they do not want any more migrants and they want to send back those who are now here here
we are on ! one ] side and on the other side there is the whole corruptor political aleet the thing is the majority of the citizens of * europe ] cannot really speak up because they are punished there are all these haspeech laws that silence people is really strange that we are the ones
we do have freedom of speech and we speak up for the majority of the citizens of * europe ] but they should also speak up and they should support hongery in our efforts
mr president could i say that the commission showed a good understanding of the construction industry
i would emphasise the need for more sea marking absolutely essential we do not want to see any more national standards and i wish this whole process every success for the future
all i would say is that i think it is a larger percentage of the overall ` gdp ] something like the @ two thousand and thirteen ] of materials are ! four ] or ! five ] or ! seven ] so it is a very important sector i am a civil engineer by background and it was a privilege to do the opinion on behalf of the industry
a very important measure in a very important industry
the construction industry does need a regulation after @ twenty years ] of having the directive in place
it is evident that gender equality must be main streamed in all policy responses to the crisis in all education and training policies in the european social fund and in other programmes social integration through employment
i have in mind a council with a wider mandate covering all economic social environmental and human development in the world
now we should do the same in the % european union ]
i think that we should pay a lot of attention to development issues also in that report
for me personally the most important achievements in this report are the recommendations on the substantial strengthening of the economic social environmental and development dimensions of the % un ] system
by developing it into a sustainable development country
my report includes several proposals for strengthening the role of the % united nations system ] in global governance and for improving the possibilities of the % european union ] and its member states to better achieve our foreign policy goals inside the system
these ideas got the lot of support in the negotiations but not enough in order to be accepted
i proposed that the ` council ] would have permanent members the % european union ] % us ] aid % japan ] and the ) brixks ] countries and rotating once
according to the report this must be done in the ~ first ] instance by means of structural and functional reform of the economic and social countries but we also call on the % eu ] institutions and the member states to consider the possibility of strengthening their role in the ecosol
mr president i would like to propose in a speech to the world economic ` council ] in double ] in @ two thousand and nine ] the creation of a % un ] economic ` council ] according to the model of the new ` end security council ]
in the negotiations on my % eu ] % un ] report i failed to emphasise the importance of security dymands and other united nations we were reluctant to strengthen the other parts of the % un ] system
we do appreciate the on resources although we would have wanted to have more ambitious our own resources
we have made an agreement in the framework of the ` united nations ] and it is called smes and in your introduction mr } kommission ] in the ` uk or young court ] mentioned the states and i think it is so extremely important that we use these bodgets to make sure that all the money that we spend in all these sectors are used to come up with good results on the sustainable development groups
all extensive scales is no longer just a due discipline
it is now a matter of human competition
this should be immediately in that condition of % eu ] release on humanitarian growth
to protect the smes and to minimise the locality and let the ` eu ] regulation offers an exemption for the smallest importance based on the threshold system designed to cover at least ! ninety five ] of all imports to the % european union ]
all industry initiatives have to fully comply with the international oecd deal with the ) eu ] deligence guidelines illegally with it to help companies respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict financing
the vicious circle has now been broken
stability in * africa ] and in all other conflict areas means less migration flows to the % european union ]
educating the stakeholders and achieving language sustainable effects is only possible by an approach based on shared responsibility
now we just have to implement this regulation
we believe that legal trade is good and that trade is meant to sustain jobs and labour possibility for people and for communities
there is ! one ] thing we can do immediately distinguished colleagues and tomorrow we can show the determination of the european parliament to ensure clean and sustainable minor supply chain
we have hampered out an effective and workable regulation now let us show everybody that we are determined to make this ~ first ] step
i received ! one million ] of refugees from neighbouring countries
to low international investigation on the killings of protestors on government 's ponserved land grabs
and to provide underestricted access for human rights organisations and ngos to all parts of the country
our resolution lists several names journalists one line activists who are kept in detention
in a pilot already in
it is a way of acting
@ next year ] we go to the citizens
so we want to hear clearly what the commission is willing
we talk in this house about performance based burchading
and @ twenty three ] where can i explain to my voters that * europe ] delivers that * europe ] have a better regulation that * europe ] has an open ear and end and delivers where companies and schools are
so this is a question breaking committee what is to bring forward and i hope that you can come over with it at least a clear message because it was so silent it was too silent
~ second ] depending on this outcome of any of ) church ] anticipated performance review is the commission willing to release the performance reserves earlier
we have our elections and we made our negotiations @ in the year two thousand and thirteen ] in
@ two thousand and seventeen ] in @ eighteen ] there we spent and now we have to wait to wait to thousand and nineteen to have an evaluation agenda this morning that is already in the member states can be committed to be spent later in
we have to speak
in this context i support the idea of drawing letting ) america ] and * africa ] more deeply into the existing transatlantic dialogue colleagues it is sometimes said that the % eu ] faces the choice between titling our strategic partnership with the us or working towards more flexible coalitions with & adequate players ] such as south africa or % brussels ]
but it is a false choice
at the ` european council ] do its part of the job
we ~ first ] have ireland a veteran forty five years in the % european union ] but now we have creation the newest accession
many of us here are convinced that the % european union ] has been in a protracted crisis striking its feed and hounted by nationalism populism and euro forest and you know what
it is about the lack of vision to face with the ) european ] fashion the ) eurozone ] needs globalisation and most notably refugee crisis
it is completely different
@ two thousand and fourteen ] @ two thousand and twenty ] will the experience of @ two thousand and fourteen ] be repeated
this renewed policy definitively leads to more local and ) european ] added value
and clarify the effects of the late start for the @ next year ] 's emphasis to review will lead to a performance with the payments in the years and until
the ex ante conditionality should formulate it leader more into greater policy and a better structured and targeted results
i am something you in this house
we need a new payment plan until
it will see commitments in the social field especially for younger people to bring to a job
@ two thousand and twenty three ] i ask you to include three respects in this cohesion master plan taking away the hinderances in the expenditure of the internet member states
member states were still working on to finalise their programmes and it came with very late agreed programmes for the new period
to practical reflection and the relation of it to ) european ] semester is established cohesion concerns with ! three ] forth of the country specific recommendations and we made a performent framework that has an example as i said for this
this house will agree on a reternation
in the resolution is the clear request we are now doubting and you could hear it @ today ] also that you want to have a mass deprivement on a sileration and this is not a theoritical thing
it means that you look and tell us honestly what does it mean if you start @ tree years later
mr president it is just to say that i thought my name would be on the signatures on this
@ two thousand and sixteen ] the ` council ] protects and supports the budget for instruments that spurve growth and thereby create jobs namely such instruments as ` erf asylum ] cosmethic response plastic and other
concerning subheding mandate economic social and territorial cohesion which is another core policy of the % european union ] for the creation of growth and jobs the ` council ] proposes limited the reductions of payment appropriations on new programmes of ! eur one hundred and ninety nine million ] operations on new programmes of one hundred and ninety nine million ] operations on
@ two thousand and sixteen ] the ` council ] has accepted in full all appropriations destined to programmes and agencies dealing with the crisis including the use of the flexibility instrument for an amount of firmly the enthry million ] of further including the use of the flexibility instrument for an amount of ( eur first ]
frankly the ` council ] and the member states are very concerned to note that not all institutions will achieve that go therefore the ` council ] has made it very clear in a statement that it expects that all efforts are deployed to avoid any additional delays in implementing this jointly agreed reduction target
this means that we wish to finance educate link investments to spare growth and jobs for example through the european fund for strictegic investments and to provide sufficient funding to tackle the steel ongoing migration crisis and related external policies
so you can see that the ` council ] stands fully behind the ) european ] gender on migration as was agreed between us in
@ two thousand and sixteen ] programmes and instruments that are related to the migration crisis and the facility for refugees in % turkey ] were not affected by reductions
that bed lock should be fully absorpt by the end of this year in accordance with the ` payment plan ]
global * europe ] the ` council ] undertook a thorough analysis in order to identify space for creating the necessary margin since the commission 's proposal for @ two thousand and seventeen ] has completely exhausted the margin for commitments
i would like to begin by stating clearly that the main trust of the ` council ] 's position is the prioritisation of expenditure
as you can see in an effort to find the right balance between the one hand a sustainable budget in times of budgetary constraints the reign throughout * europe ] and on the other hand financing a shared sential political priorities the ` council ] has identified areas where savings are reasonable and necessary
in those areas that cannot be qualified as stop political priorities in the current circumstances reductions in the proposal of the commissioner 's reply in a careful fashion in order not to harm programmes the performance and the coming up to speed
subhering money however has also contributed to the general saving savings set forth concerning some budget lines where the ` council ] considers following a detailed technical analysis that the commission has over stimated the real needs
i think this commission shows that we may have some different views but in general we are united by the fact that we want to have a workable budget a good budget for ) european ] citizens
for transport to ! seventeen ] and we want to keep the main focus of these discussions on @ two thousand and seventeen ] budget
* european ] surviving global economy only as a competitive economy
if i may just very briefly to some of the important points which were made during the discussion
looking forward to our cooperation
madam president it is just changed as we have in that we have too many priorities and too little money and the question is how we use the money in the best possible way
all the people have to feel our assistance
we have to stop all supplies of military agreements to the & anti mocratic government ] in the region
of course we have to be ready careful enough to support the forces and movements with smes ideology
we have to have a united ) european ] position
on @ ten octen ] of @ september two thousand and nine ] @ last week ] the commission adopted a communication on stepping up international climate finance which aims at spending up the international negotiations
in this respect it is worth mentioning the global partnership on technology which aims at doubling investment in local global technologies
with ! two hundred and fifty ] fifty pages of negotiating tax on the table the negotiations we have not yet gathered sufficient momentum to come to an agreement that is ambitious and detailed enough
however among most parties there is a sense of federation and the greeningness to focus on areas of convergence
money will make or break the deal we need to mobilise private investment and promote the establishment of a robust international carbon market but substantial public funding will also be required
furthermore we have to strengthen support to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the increasing adverse effects of climate aims
there is a donging task i heard of first with the intense negotiations of the coming months but failure is not an option
we need comparable and more ambitious emission reduction targets for the group of developed candidates which in agriculture today offer less than ! fifteen ] of the national reduction as compared to national reduction as compared
it is not only that it is also the other carset as we have been cheating and the differences in a different member states like some of them are mandatory the others are voluntary some are only on the national carman carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon and others are different
how will you do that
we also have to look to the future and yes we have to care about our car industry but a new area is coming it will be electrified it will be sharing mobility and if we do not make sure that we do that for our industry that we do not make sure that we have a zero emission mandate then the cars will be important from % china ] and otherwhere in the world and our car industry will have a big problems also and this millions of people and
! three million ] cars have not been recalled yet
how should the commission make sure that all consumers in * europe ] have the same right
i actually restrict the access to the % eu ] market affording which could be a consequence of such extensive regulations
a regulation could really harm the economies of developing words and could actually cost jobs there
@ ten weeks ago ] tabilisation and association agreement entered into force
! one ] political development is that reducing corruption and organised crime and making judicial emore efficient has been assessed as good by the commission
a lot has already been said about the magnitude of this right 's violation and about the relevance of the topic trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed with a human rights faced and victim centred approach
victims and vulnerable populations need to be put at the centre of all efforts
the prevention of trafficking in human beings and the protection of its victims must be our priority goal
access to transition support measures shelter and education need to be ensured independent of the victims willingness to cooperate in criminal proceedings
the principle of non criminalisation in this regard is also vital and needs to be implemented in all member states
further demand needs to be tackled as it can be considered a root cause
accountability needs to be ensured for both offenders as well as knowing uses
for the new strategy i think that financial investigations and action against money laundering need to play a bigger part in fighting trafficking in human beings and ensuring that confiscated sets are used to support and compensate victims of trafficking
does the commission agree on this and how does it intend to address this in the new strategy
i am vorried about the trend of trafficking in human beings being mixed up with other legally distinct concepts such as migrant smuggling increasingly addressing trafficking in human beings through a security link for instance in the context of recent migration policies
how will the commission count on this strength in its new strategy
i also call for greater internal external coherence in the fight against trafficking in human beings and to further enhance and deepen cooperation in coordination among all relevant actives
that would give the enlargement a more prominent presence supplementing the usual progress reports for the countries
therefore i sincerely welcome the commission 's strategy and the action plan as documents which will officially and permanently put a vestment board on the large mandate on the european agenda
it became also clear that we simply cannot wait for all major political issues to be settled before we endeavour further enlargement
or this could provide a strong political better drop for the difficult work that oberates on all sides in order to welcome the frontrunner countries % syria ] and multinaeous food members
additionally i would call the commission to draw up annual reports concerning the implementation of this strategy and the action plan which should be discussed here in the plenary
it is important not just for the countries of the region but also for the % european union ] itself because without providing a credible perspective for full membership for all the countries of the * western bulgans ] the % eu ] global role will not be credible because this is our origin this is our ~ first ] commitment
we need to invest more both politically and financially yes it is a difficult process because enlargement is a common effort
at the same time there is always an alternative we should not forget and the alternative is embracing nationalism and populism and creating rival risk and hostilities again
when there is a will there is always a way and @ last year ] the republic of message only made transgress progress back to words progress and ) european ] perspective
the public violence the hate speech against a ) liberalia ] people in % egypt ] is rampantly increasing and we are reporting that
today we are passing on the message mr } commissioner ] is just not enough you do not pass the message about human rights you demand human rights to be respected
i differently need a different kind of partnerships
but @ today ] i wanted to raise the specific situation of ` edubit ] 's persecuted
it is also a question of when there are authorities do this kind of violence
we are really for more complete cooperation in this field and the badness in priorities are given as a portunity to explore new forms of common engagement
these were the ~ first ] association council with % egypt ] in @ seventy years ] so the ~ first ] is the beginning of the revolves in their war
mr president the ` ecr group ] recognises the practical value of regional development funding and supports efforts to ensure it is spent more efficiently this six report clearly caused for more to be done there it is not a clean bill of health
i and others in the group are not wholly convinced that there is as full and understanding as there should be that this funding is not a revenue substitute nor is it intended to be for more than a third of the century has been the case
furthermore i do not believe that part of the agenda behind the inother respects and objectionable urban policy is desirable either especially and i quote to improve the democratic legitimacy of the ) european ] project
best practice and cooperation yes
i welcome those elements
to share a decontral free or checkfree travel in the @ frontiers of the schengen area ] is a basic principle in one of the greatest achievements in the % european union ] although recent tragic events indeed both % schengen ] to
the ) turboil ] documents are checked on the official checkpoints why not all other ) european ] citizens have to undergo such monitoring
we must do or best in order to provide security for everyone under cogress circumstances such discrimination and unjustified violation of the & schengen agreement ] is both unacceptable and unreasonable
this is exactly the aim of the european year of citizens @ two thousand and thirteen ] to mark the @ two thousand and thirteen ] to mark the @ twenty one ] vestory of the establishment of the union citizenship by the treaty of mastering and to give a numerous citizenship
as members of the ` european parliament ] the only directly elected % eu ] institution which have a crucial round to play in promoting the aims of the european development citizens @ two thousand and thirteen ] by bridging the gap between brassels and member states communicating rights and benefits of the ) eu ] citizenship and turning citizens concerns informulating participative democracy
to enjoy protection by the diplomatic or considerable volaties of any member state in a ~ third ] country
all % eu ] citizens must be informed and enjoy without discrimination all rights granted to them by union law and the chapter of financial rights i
in view of the ` european elections ] we must raise our warness on the legislative parts of the ` european parliament ] and encourage citizens to vote so that their voice is heart clear by human decision makers
to address the institutions of the % union ] to enjoy free movement of goods and services consumer protection public health equal opportunities equal treatment access to employment and to social protection to enjoy the new right of the % european ] citizens initiative granted by the & lisbon treaty ] to strengthen participative democracy through access to new treatment and administration
at times of economic political and social crisis only @ twenty months ] before the @ next european elections ] putting union civil sensitive and participative democracy at the centre of the political agenda is absolutely essential
to petition the ` european parliament ]
we need to support ` yazo ] in order that people arriving at heavy recycle and application properly proceed
the ~ second ] point is we have to change the normal crature of the med budget lines because putting integration in the return together on ! one ] budget line just a bointing being clear on what the money is being spared
but of course we have some ) christians ] on details it is our matters of tremendous political importance that we need to debate
i as wonder why the europol should receive the same increase in funding and staff as ` easo ]
you had a very energy efficient airplain and then it could fly on solar
development was lifted on an equal fooding with diplomacy and effence
we have to fight against poverty and promote economically and socially sustainable development all over the world
in development policy we have to act in close cooperation with the % united states ] since in this field our basic values growth and interests are very close to each other
this is how we can most effectively tackle the root causes of our recent security and migration challenges
saying a firm no to eff gm for me also means that we have to have protected laws and we have to provide strong support to the gross roots organisations that work on this
it is a simple three deprint that i think every woman should be in proud possession of because knowing your body is also a way to take back control to take back power
@ today ] we see their tax on women 's bodies from the reliance of tramps with his awful gagroup that wants to threaten women 's sexual and reproductive health and rights worldwide
we say no to all forms of particular control over our bodies and we say just to sexual freedom and choice per women and for proper sexuality indication where we can learn about our rights and our women 's rights and our bodies and about children
it has nothing to do with religion but it has all to do with religion but it has nothing to do with religion but it has nothing to do with religion with particularly
these struggles are linked
many people do not even know what it looks like and the dictionaries in @ two thousand and seventeen ] still get it wrong
it is also simple matters for me that the countries almost everywhere have been systematically neglected and araised
we see notafging support grants road organisations
as colleagues have said the proximity of ( eur one hundred and thirty million ] women and girls have been victims of fgm if gm is older than ) christianity ] or % islam ]
if you many have jumped activists that fight against effective
colleagues commission our message must be here
but say no to eff jm also demands that we say no to all forms of hoterical control of our bodies
in @ the past year ] all our attention of us focused towards the lowering of ! sero ] two emissions and particular matters without devoting enough attention to nox
with the new proposal we are introducing new real driving emissions tests that are closest to the real world use and we will also introduce new type of proval legislation that will help these are caused to become much cleaner but we do not need new agencies for that
we should use this period to prepare new development plans focusing on new innovative technologies in order to safeguards * europe ] 's position of being the number one car maker in the world
we need stronger rules that will effectively deal with the emission problems for these all cars
@ for the upcoming years ] the clear classical technologies based on forcing use and the authority of solutions will be present side by side
but at the same time there are some disappointing informations
as the rapporteur has stated we tackled very important topics like frequency with all blowers geographing and licences always defending freedom of expression which is the crucial and essential point of our concern
and now we have a decision that for the ~ first ] time in this ` parliament ] is rejected by all the political groups by all the committees with the huge majority almost unanimity
i almost feel sorry for the commission
madam president it is hard to believe that we are sitting here @ today ] discussing minor changes to the rules for value added to the rules of value
no doubt the justice towards the % european union ] will continue but democratically elected governments have a primary interest in looking after the populations that elected them
never mind that prudent government finances are essential to the survival of the euro there is nothing else that these countries can do about their budgets
probably an even more serious concern is the huge exposure of cell ) europe ] 's ) eurozone ] countries to the devalting debt of eastern * europe ]
i therefore ask the commission to urge the implementation of local primary health strategy to impress healthy licentile awareness campaigns and the early introduction of screening programmes across * europe ] so that we can meet our goals of healthy ageing by @ two thousand and twenty ] weeks
building in mind the guidelines for collarating cancels creaning from @ two thousand and ten ] @ last week ] i hosted the conference with a launch a wide paper setting this donor for the prevention dignoses treatment and care of collarated cancel across * europe ]
if we take so long with the rule of local countries like % single port ] imagine how long we will take with bigger more prolimatic countries
with sovereign criminals getting better at breaking into protected networks i strongly believe that the only real way to win the bottle is to have people with similar knowledge and expertise fighting against them
mr president even though i thought you message that i should not ask for the floor i do it at anyway
i do think that it is actually a fundamental right to have a basic banking account
governments feel the scepticism of public opinion and tried to transfer responsibility to their commission
so the % eu ] is an hypocritical situation where the ` council ] does not approve gm owners but some member states cultivate them
usually our group is propen and of community approach but in this particular case we should not have ! one ] size of its own policy
the inclusion of complementary environmental reasons as well as list of social economic grounds for the restriction or prohibition of their engi ors by member states will make this report more legally solid
mr president any operator that is responsible for damage to the environment must be held appropriate for their actions
however the determination of the accountability should be down to the member of state
you mention the establishment of a ~ secondary ] liability regime based upon the systems already adopted by several members of state
this is typical of the % eu ] implementing more or more a necessary legislation
the report calls for the consideration of a ) european ] fund for the ) remedying of environmental damage
if you propose this fund who is going to pay for it
the implementation of the ` council ] decision of @ two thousand and four ] would greatly encourage % turkey ] to implement the ` ecr ] association agreement
as meps i hope that we can send a strong message on behalf of those citizens who are in favour of a free internet where the privacy of users and their rights are respected fully we must today stand behind the block of citizens amendments that have been tabled as the best way of defending those rights of our citizens
these amendments if passed will restore some source of balance between end users rights and freedoms and the rights and freedoms of others including the right to intellectual property protection and indeed the right to privacy
the aim of this proposal should be to protect those who need protection but also to strengthen the rights of citizens to access information within the law when and where they see fish
service providers should be made act in a transparent manner at all times and if in very exceptional cases restrictions to access are required they should be fully accountable in justifying these restrictions
national powers should have a role in investigating any restriction that serves providers impose
for the moment the cotoral clending undertaken by diatory other precious sides they have seemed has not taken place at % palmira ] one of the greatest of all course of the * middle east ]
indeed the destruction of such sides is in fact country to its lamic scollership where previous civilisations and the learning and architector of antiquity was studied preserved often incorporated and in a positive sense used
as my colleague } borroso jonson ] the mare of % london ] has put it this is not a clash of civilisations
as a former ) un ] } unnecessary will heritish side chairman myself the thought that this wonderous juel could be destroyed concerns me and so many others deeply never forgetting the probably over ! thousand ] people who have lost their lives in around the side
@ two ] additionally there are separate votes undermandments @ twenty six ] ! thirty six ] forty six seventy one and eighty one and eighty one ]
they concern the same issue that we know lost so i proposed that we vote all of this in the block
member states because in relation to the single market more and more personal data of people from ! one ] country member state will be collected store and used in other member states
they were to have some effect but i think we need to take attention of the loopholes
they collaborate supporting each other
so in this regard we really would like to see in a future much more pro active and cooperative for all from commission side otherwise it will be very difficult for us to cooperate
however madam commissioner there was a key measure missing from your proposal
a unique sense of ownership of sea and its resources and a real form of regionalisation will be established i want to call upon all members of this ` parliament ] to give this measure some time to a unique sense of ownership of sea and its resources and real form of resolution
it will allow us to restore fees and increase the income of fishermen throughout the % european union ] by increasing both the quantity and the size of fiscal
i would like to very welcome the constitutional reform of % albania ] has been successfully going through which is a very very difficult task we all understand that but we also know that when it comes to judicial reform it is the implementation which the most difficult and most implementation with the most difficult and most important task if obenia engages in this reform process according to its member state
mr president i think that is a very reasonable question and yes of course we can only use market based surveillance to go back in * europe ] but i think that is a very reasonable question and yes of course we
a finger should also use other instruments like regulation for instance
we have just adopted an energy efficiency directive that will definitely also put us in the right direction
because this is a huge massive problem that needs a fundamental change in the way we consume and produce energy
that is the best way we have now and that is the existing
probably know how business we are
! four ] ! thousand days ] and nights nearly eleven years
i am recent participant in the way to witter side and i have to say that i am more than surprised and impressed about how much information is on that side from the % european union ] it is a huge amount of information and i would like to congratulate them further
i am sure that this question for freedom is universal and that the % eu ] has a moral obligation and a strategic interest to avoid most tragedies in the * mediterranean ] by promoting peace security and the rule of law in a more firm and assertive way in the countries of origin
she was thankful for reaching the free world she became really happy only when her home land was finally free from oppression and eventually we came back to % croatia ]
we know that there is a shortage of skilled labour in this area at the same time there are lots of people who will lose their jobs and will need retraining
we hope that we will go all together
the design must improve the framework for digital service provides to stimulate growth but it must also make the fight against illegal content more successful and it must improve the tense permanency and oversight
ideology i therefore are all our own values and we have the economic benefits of which we enter using ` eib ] develop on other continents without those values and we doubt a large part of the economic benefits
a strong risk based approach offers the best way forward here these challenges are difficult but i fully support the effect the effect the efforts of all the rapporteurs here @ today ] and we are not even close to setisfying legal situation but these reports are in excellent starts
and some people born in a different time like myself might want to go back to how it was before because it seems to like a simple time
the future will be more digital not less and it brings incredible progress that we as policy makers should embrace
brings dangers that we cannot ignore any more
let us be honest with each other colleagues the % eu ] has done more to regulate the online world than any other countenance
over the past degates we have not followed up illegal content and illegal activities online with the same regard as illegal activities offline
we have not achieved any meanful tense parents overhaul elegal items boost content to users on a messive scale
we have not grasped the impact of it on our democracies our culture and our fundamental rights
instead we have focused on voluntary cooperation which is good but not good enough
not nearly good enough
we cannot leave this over to the private sector we doubt oversight and enforcement we must keep this in the public debate as a priority and we must irregulate no matter how dynical these files are
the difficult challenge before us is to find a balance between digital progress and respect of indemental rights
the value of law making is the real charter change its effects
if we start off with conflicting regulations and directives that undermine each other instead of complementing each other we have lost the battle before it starts
we must respect the scope of each digital
~ secondly ] the fendamentally of the e commerce directive were great but its greatest issue was transparency
we must improve and enforce meanful transparency and i call for a clear mandate from this ` parliament ]
% turkey ] we all agree on the importance of notice and action mechanisms to remove illegal content online but this places the burden almost entirely unusers we therefore should compliment notice and action before an appropriate obligation to remove illegal content and its public attorities which should provide effending to follow up on this
finally i would like of course personally to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all my colleagues on the lebaslave report for their excellent cooperation
they established some priorities
to our children and young people who have to pass not titles and theoretical topics but above all practical values
indeed a location and culture has to do with civil investion
golden vices make a negative impact on the status of % eu ] residence and citizenship
let me outline briefly what the commission is already doing to improve its prementation
we are worried by the deteriorating situation when it comes to respect for human rights persecution of political opponents as well as journalists is becoming a rule in this country for the contrast the country which is on the one hand incredibly reached in oil and diamonds and on the other hand has ! one ] of the hardst race of child more tality in the world
all these depriving the people of % fanguala ] for basic human rights access to healthcare full education by still in public money intended for basic social services we are seriously concerned about the possible mismanagement of % eu ] development funds by the ` local authorities ] and in this regard we are requesting from the commission to review the national indicative programme under the eleven of ` eu ] development funds by the ` local authorities ] who are depriving the people of % fangual ] of their basic human rights access to health care full education by still in public money intended for basic social services we are seriously concerned about the possible mission from the commissio
mr president after the case of conflict in stability and goal accontinues to face major challenges if we govern as highly as here the * month ] 's deal then you president after
however it should be a decision taken by the % eu ] as a whole and of course coordinated with the ` us tourkis ] and the & arab link ]
it is important that & fatca book ] is not only doing adds as they say is their business model but also deliver for trust in a way of delivering solutions and actions in the way of how they do their business model
i would also agree it is very important to understand that there is a missing brick in this wall and that is the privacy regulation
we need to get more rules and place especially also for consumer control to get connectivity across the platforms in order to have a choice
just and just earning money by endeavouring the data of individuals has to change because that is not only the business model
we still need to fix that problem because the communication data needs to be protected in a specific way
so we can be very proud as the % european union ] and especially of ` parliament ] that we have a tool to protect the privacy and integrity of our citizens life with the & gdpr ] in place
it is about fundamental rights privacy and warness but privacy enforcement as well namely the right to be forgotten enshrined by the ` gdpr ]
but it is also about democracy because fake news is a high red war of intoxication many political lies and hates peach aimed to weaken democracy through interfering innovations and inhancing populism and ) europobia ] so it takes a response to ) european ] which means that no member state can do it on its own before a givant indeed intellectual facebook but also legal binding and effective law but also legal binding and effective law but also it means that no member state can do it on its own before a guidant in the intellectual echoes
that is what the ) european ] citizens are expecting from all of us and that is precisely and exactly what we ask from you
the commission must take initiative action and now
reporting the resource is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of the % european union ] because the guarantee does need member states fulfill their international low obligations and that they can trust each other and the institutions of the % european union ]
the % european union ] was founded on the principles of respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights
we are failing to do so many have several consequences including the possibility of the % european union ] to fall apart almost each @ the years ] by its @ foundation ]
right before our ice
this report also has other important implications for the fundamental rights of minorities roman children women and eduptive people and for those seeking asylum
this was proved in the last capital of years this must be rectified that is why in this report we call for a new mechanism that is ultimately triggered in case of breaches of fundamental values and rights to avoid democratic trades to avoid democracy and trade to avoid democracy authorisation of systematic trades in member states our common ) european ] fundamental values are being traded first and foremost from % visin ]
to now focus we mean that we will be missing some targets
too many mandates and at the same time can lead to fragmentation and to high cross
so we should keep finding the right balance and finding the trade office to be focused and efficient in the work and ` eib ]
through venues programmes and exchange of best practices and know how and by ensuring the availability of necessary funding for education training agreements raising and empirement of women as well as for the continuous fight against ingender vulnerable stakeholders fight against ingender vulnerable stakeholders fight against ingender vulnerable stakeholders and discrimination
it is about jobs and it is about money
i understand that we are involved in a big legal battle with % norway ] i believe that we can find enough good lawyers to win this battle
it is about ) european ] citizens thrust into ) european ] commission and institutions
just let me give you ! few ] examples
mr } fle ] has listened carefully to the debate @ today ] in courage by this basis for the commission to mention it
we need to speak vitally quality we need to counteract raises % sena fobu ]
i was in the rivals house waiting to go out through customs when we heard and felt the ~ first ] explosion
no right to surveillance technology in the world can do that
then the ~ second ] explosion and some of us thought that the roof was coming down upon us
my body remembers that fear and it is in data feeling that i refuse those that say that we have to learn to learn to live with this terrorism is man made and we can undo it
it is the moment to step back for a moment to just pause and think through the implications of our actions and tenor
we are taking the right measures to invest massively into better equipment and better cooperation of our police and security services and into effective derogicalisation or are we still putting forward expensive and simpolic measures of massive and simpolic measures against completely innocent citizens
thereby weakening effective security and our freedoms together which we defend
therefore i am very happy that commissioner } king ] is starting to investigate into the effectiveness of the ( hundreds of security ] measures which the % european union ] and its member state has adopted throughout the years
if this is what you are calling for then we will come back in * europe ]
however the most offensive position that you have taken is the proposal that spain will have the right to visa any brexit deal over the issue of % gibraltar ]
i do however have a solution to prevent % gibraltar ] being used as a pawn in practice negotiations and indeed end spanish claims wants and for all make % gibraltar ] a fully integrated part of the % uk ]
i have been calling this @ for many years ] and with the unique opportunities that % brexit ] has given us i believe it is an idea whose time has come
give % gibraltar ] real influence and the voice in * westminster ] and send a clear message that % gibraltar ] is not facilitated
give here and our other oversight secretaries their own member of ` parliament ]
in this area we the % uk ] can lend from our continental cosms because the french give representation to their oversight territories and i propose that we should too
this i guarantee would cause amendments damage to the economies of the % european union ] and good resolve in putting many of your citizens out of work it is what we call in the % uk ] cutting off your nose to spite your face
i want to make it clear in this chamber @ today ] the people of % japrilta ] are proudly ) british ] in @ two thousand and two ] ! ninety nine ] of ) gibraltarians ] voters in ) referendum ] against shared sovereignty with % spain ] and the wishes of the people shared sovereignty with % spain ] and the ) wishes ] of the people shared sovereignty with % spain ] and the ) wishes ] of the people shared sovereignty with % spain ] and the ) wishes ] of the people shared sovereignty with % spain ]
~ first ] our position our attitude at promited pro ) europeans ] is very well described in % hamlet ] when } russia ] describes the expression of the father of % hamlet at countness ] more than in anger that will be our attitude in our negotiation
i will just underline ! four ] ideas that seem to me of the utmost importance on the subject
however it is a step that should not be taken lightly
to me as an mep the effects of climate change to the rights of internal speople are well very close to my heart because warming climate is to direct or indirect cause for many of the violations against their rights
we need to understand and be aware of that
bad consolidation needs to be complemented by a social investment strategy that will address the social employment in education taxpayers of the % eu ] ! two thousand and twenty ] strategy
i had no answer but his office refused to respond to my emails
gender diversity on burns leads to more sustainable decisions and therefore emerges trans ) european ] economy
i would therefore like to stress again the importance of reaching first leading agreement on an issue which is so important to the % european union ] citizens
% stonia ] has chosen ! four ] main objectives for the @ next six month ]
the logical order of these ! four ] objectives seems clear the inclusive and sustainable * europe ] that % stonia ] wants to promote as the ~ fourth ] objective will be closer if the ~ first ] ! three ] objectives are achieved
this regalls may certainly firstly date are more inclusive and sustainable * europe ]
i am confident and convinced that in the months to come % stonia ] will go in the direction of the nouncing annual bridge of fundamental rights in the % european union ]
question development we have reached a do so because so far we have not yet restricted ! one ] single substance using the reach system
that was my question if it is really appropriate and it will be if it were worried
let me say that such a policy shift would be a strategic blunder the % eu ] should continue to do what it is doing only do it better
therefore i would say that recent events in % russia ] and the presidential elections actually present a case for staying decorums in terms of our policy
` iran ] 's some of its citizens as threats repression happens to real people people with family and friends
questioning is basically what is the commission doing to prevent execution of these innocent people who only dream occressing freedom
since the ) irish ] and options are limited and their cash flow is limited and their foreign currencies are not limited they might very well offer as quipprokrow navel basis or air basis to % russia ] or % chinese military ] in the * middle east ] and this is of course all bad news very bad news for anyone but also in the % european union ]
as according to the jacific pq which we fully support and also as a diplomatic success from the % european union ] i would ask you in the @ next eleven days ] in beyond to do your utmost best
i admit most viables or dependent on who makes the decisions in the @ beginning of next year ] in % washington ] but right now and at @ next couple of months ] we have an expiring weapons and bargo and there is no movement from the % us ] aid to be expected i would create a dohnting challenge to restrain and limit arms to % us ] to expect i would create a dohn ting challenge to restrain and limit or say to % us ] to * europe ] and i was very pleased to learn that a while ago that ) european ] efforts to restrain and limit or at least to delay arm sales to * europe ]
the alternative means that the final solution is welcome because basing will sell its arms
the same page
our talks with * europe ] were bigging in % moscow ] on going can you assure me that we are doing everything that we can and to restrain
the ) iranian ] foreign minister has welcomed it an eleven days from now like the ) islamic ] revolutionary } gadcaul ] has said a new faith in military cooperation between % iran ] and the world will commend
debates however seem to be concentrating on who ever gets the ticket in the wide house
still hope to limit arms even still hope to limit arms ever
no way then a peaceful solution out of this long ongoing conflict international peace needs to be an international end over
it is therefore absolutely unacceptable that the countries are turkey for example contributes with mercinaries among other things to worse and the situation even more the % eu ] is a region bill to that ideal dialogue is the only way forward for long losting peace it is our duty at the same time to take leadership for those ideas in our neighbouring countries
i am glad that the international community is ready to assist any unity to support the ongoing process in % osce ]
that is what we have had to improve and i really appreciate that you are taking this under agenda and i would really see that member states are supporting you in making better use of these systems
so yes in the beginning of this huge transition we will still need for so few and therefore % eu ] policies should support carbon capture and able government support schemes for blue hidder gen i expect the commission to move forward in this direction in its energy summer package
our biggest problem is that the perfective is becoming the enemy of the good
infrastructure in the scale of electrolises but also in carbon capture unilisation and storage because we need to be realistic
well all together that is not a sustainable postum
! high region ]
we have @ thirty years ] to rechape our entire energy system and we can do it and we will fail if we demand to be perfect but we will definitely succeed by doing it as good as we can
and just look at the political debates no new clear energy please no cover capture that untils fossil fuels no bio mass no gas in a transition no wind mills in my back yard and no solar penals on agricultural grounds please
how can it possibly be serious in reaching our climate goals without technologies like governing capture by omar } annuclea ]
it might not be a silver bullet but we all agree this energy carrier has enormous potential and our aim is clear to create a new clean produce green hijarity markets and a long term certainty for all parties involved and that requires massive investments
if we want to pave the way for clean hide region realitionally will be to invest in transitional technologies and these might not be perfect but they are good
welcoming criminals into our % european union ] with open arms just because those criminals are rich is totally outrageous and means for feeding that trust because regardless of what the ) syparian ] or any other government thinks the access
to ! one ] % eu ] country passport also means the access to the whole % eu ] with all the benefits that takes years for normal people to enjoy even though they might have been a cemplary habitant
this is not having a sincere cooperation nor is it upholding the integrity of what an % eu ] citizenship should mean convicted oligarchs and corrupt businessman have nothing to do here in the % eu ]
the ~ second ] is also why does it think it include all the countries who have this kind of system in place referring to the infringement process of course
in this respect we welcome on efforts to maintain common safety standards to put in place with other 's protection measures strict controls in training in safety procedures as well as for enforcing regular risk assessment and preventing measures by employers
we should not be hypocritical cleaning formally to the letter of the treaty and taking it as a ) christian ] as an excuse to look aside from the real situation
hindering the livery of tangible benefits for our citizens and posing problems for those wishing to live work or do business across borders it is time to people at the heart of % eu ] policy making bioding fing problematic areas dismantling citizens barriers and improving primplementation in ways which result in concrete benefits in the daily lives of our citizens
i am harmong competition they are creating an anfair way in crising inequality
maybe most of them are actually legal but they met not only because in views of many people they are immoral they met her because they are harming our society
we cannot only read by example but more decisively use soft and hard powers to pursue the others that are making the game unfair
in some cases do not be afraid to go for harmonisation
since this is the moment where i have to turn to finance ministers because they have the power
much to be worried about presecution of opposition and journalists and therefore i think the % eu ] has to stand up ~ first ] of the % european ] balance and condition enhanced cooperation on convincing progress in the field of human rights
that 's evident from the recently leaked capalls with ! one ] participant stating it is impressive to see how some member states present themselves outwardly as proponents of tax reforms and at the same time to watch in the code of conduct group how they actually behave any new discussions protected by confidentiality
i actually listen to my constituents and i know they are furious about tax dodging both businesses and individuals
as i said there is no ornor for complacency and many things have to be done
ahead of the meeting as we know some % eu ] leaders voice concerns about external detablising influences on the region and these happening mentioned again > tonight ]
i believe our response has to be ever more visible and strong engagement in the region to support those forces that fight for human rights and the rule of law
the % eu ] is a peace project a project that aims to end frequent and bloody warrant between neighbours horrible experiences that the * western bulkins ] know only too well
the prospects of ) european ] integration from % montinegro ] and the * western balkans ] is therefore essential for peace in the region and across * europe ]
as the commissioner noted montinegro continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to % eu ] integration
its steady progress in opening chapters is not only bringing it closer to % eu ] accession but as many others have said is also providing a positive example for other countries in the region
migrap tables a number of amendments to the report specifically focused on enhancing human rights
i am pleased that many of these are reflected in the reports covering topics from ensuring media freedom to improving working conditions for civil society to better arrangements for victims of gender based violence to eliminating obstacles to healthcare education hising an employment for ruman people
i am referring to that because we are at the crossroads
i think the fast track the commission and ` parliament ] is now attributing is an achievement because it is bottom up
a ~ second ] issue which is important and on also an achievement for ` parliament ] is we are reflecting that we are living in an ever changing innovation environment it is new its fast and busied capital and its competitive
but we failed
tackle children 's cancer
we for the ~ first ] time do not fight the fight between several reduction and competitivenesses that we just focus on energy production what we are going to do is yes it is not a contradiction to do severe reduction and to be competitive but we have to do something about that and that is the focus on manufacturing we want to have severe ! two ] free steel plans
leading but we have to do something about that leadership and we want to do want to have a continued continued in @ ten years ] from now
it is not for standay speeches it is not for the sake of the ecodemic life it is about the substance of the well being of that continent
the reason why of the well being of that continent relates starting in the @ eighteen century ] on its ability to innovate
this is the competent which is open to the world
we do not want to have the ) america ] ~ first ] lack the % united states ]
we have fast enough in the international context
the historic legacy of enlightement is very much related to that
if we want to ask the world to work together with us
we have more of a bottom up approach
we want to have more often ambition but we want to align serious reduction and competition
i think what is important to understand is that this is not yet another programme but one of the biggest contribution to the ` european economy ] but also to the well being of the ) european ] citizens
i think what we are going to achieve with that programme is first of all we are going big we tackling the big challenges which are related to the ordinary life of citizens
we in terms of technology and we want to have a quantity of computer
research if you are innovative you are smart if you are smart if you are innovative you go to the commission in you could say in the framework of what had been decided in the programme do we get funded
i am in view of the population in * europe ] but the basis of our well being is innovation
by the ` dprk ] on a south corean island
we also expect % china ] to clearly condemn this act
there have been severe casualties among the south car in military and especially under the ( seven ] population of that island
we welcome that % barron ] 's action the high representative 's action in a concerned manner with other international actors our allies and our strategic partner the republic of corea in condemning this clear violation of the ` un corean ] ambitious agreement
we call on the ` dprk ] to avoid any further escalation and to undertake all necessary efforts to maintain peace and stability on the ) carion ] peninsula
such prevention prisapposals major commitment as well as sustained and consistent efforts by the commission by national governments of countries experiences such financial society international agencies and other stakeholders
there are still types against women preventing them to fully enjoy equal treatment and employment and educational opportunities in many countries
this is her raising but underly posted problem in several countries
i am talking about
but even worse than those billions is frustration and anger when attories take artists and we love them we prove this today a company proprietor or a worker a student a patient or a doctor cannot find those necessary information afformed to fill out when the ` hero she and ` council ] formed to fill out when the hero she encounters problems when delivering documents online this portal will help solving those problems and i find it especially important today when some politicians call * europe ] and the imaginary community
we would all like to see jobs back in * europe ]
we just had a very good discussion on youth unemployment earlier to this discussion and i really think that we have an obligation to look into all possibilities of supporting growth and job creation
in this perspective one might be minor but importantly could be imploying financial participation in the fp
` efp ] can strengthen small and medium sized enterprises offering mechanisms for innovative financing as workers may wish to invest in chairs in their own company by which they are employed
despite these possible benefits the focus on ` eu pe ] various from member state to member state
this is a reason for me to participate in this very important debate @ today ] because when it comes to imploying share ownership and employing financial participation the commission and ` parliament ] as was mentioned by ` my colleague from the ppe olion ] has been talking along a lot of this
we have done starteds and we have collected information data and knowledge
now i think it is time to act
i would like to ask the commissioner a very simple question
are you planning to put forward a proposal for an action plan on this issue
we have adopted an opinion on employee financial participation we have made several studies we have adopted a resolution we have completed a pilot project and so on
i am sure that this was a mistaken i hope you will fix that
in polance a catching of regional initiative has held for example to improve their condition for starting the business the management of financial instruments or special planning practices
i understand very well that some of you may seem to me demand in @ too much ] but on the other hand we all know that children 's intequality of governance hinders the penalty of public investments
i very much welcome the aim of maintaining of these reports
instead of reinstating border checks and undermining one of the % eu ] 's fundamental freedoms we need closer coordination among our security and law enforcement agencies instead of getting ever greater amounts of data and undermines civil debate is the need more effective intelligent chailing to collect the dota from the information we already collect
this is the way in which this polish authority this polish government is the polish government this polish government is the way in which this is the way in which this polish authority this is the way in which this polish authority this is the way in which this polish authority this polish government this polish government this polish government is the way in which this polish government it is polish majority acts
so far and softly right when she explained it it is absolute
we are all running
we have no idea what is happening there
they are all wrong and they are all right
the problem in poland is that they are trying to change the state and to model it so that generations to come will have no chance to change it back for the better
that is the thing that we have to be concerned about because there are ! millions ] and ! millions ] of poles probably ! half of them ] more than ! half of them that would still make up a pretty big member state who want a future in * europe ]
who wanted a bogradic future
those poles we are standing up for because they have chosen to be part of the ) european ] society and that is why we care
they send their children to % special ] so called ) european ] school which is completely isolated from the rest of the world
our mistages discover your talent
at that time we were focused upon the whole business of the modernisation of the modernisation of competition policy the significant amount of work taken forward by former commissioner } maria monte ] and by the current commissioner } nealy crucia ] and looking at the impact of that in terms of the commission 's ability to deal with the abuse of market power to deal with the impact of that in terms of the commission 's ability to deal with the merges and state aid
we have seen record activity on the part of the commission in terms of dealing with hard call car tells we have seen the development of the leniency system and we have seen record fines put into operation by the commission and we have seen record activity in terms of murders and state aid neutifications as well
but i mention the change of contacts because of course we all recognise that since the reports were published by the commission the commission 's work in terms of state aid particularly has really taken on a rather different dimension
it is very important and our report says so that in addressing those matters we recognise some of the challenges that there are for an effective open market
it is one very clear area in the % united kingdom ] at the moment is one very clear area where there will have to be when economic circumstances become a little carmor a general review of the new architecture that we have got and whether that are cotected really is compatible with the operation of a free fair and open market
mr president the commission produces its annual competition report and it is traditional for the ` parliament ] to cast its eye over the report and produce an own initiative reaction to it
that is something similarly that our committee and ` parliament ] has been supported off
in this case because of timing factors the reports for ! two thousand and six ] and ! two thousand and six ] and ! six ] and two thousand and seven have been brought together but taking up one of the points mentioned by commissioner } barroso little bit ] earlier it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather marketly since in fact we began the exercise of considering the reports some time ago
our committee 's drawn attention to ! two ] specific concerns what we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers particularly in relation to food retailing % eu ] retailing % eu ] retailing
it is very important that when the commission gives its approval it is giving that approval in ways which are compatible with the treaty and do not create such significant market power in future that that becames a synaria for abuse in its own right
almost on a daily basis the commission is now looking at the effect of the bailouts that are taking place in the context of the great financial termoil
but enlarge that has been a very good story in these reports and that is very clear from the reaction that we have from ` parliament ] 's own report
this is a process that is gathering pays in terms of modernisation because the commission is currently bringing forward proposals in a wide paper on introducing private damages
to me as an mep the effects of climate change to the rights of internal speople are well very close to my heart because warming climate is to direct or indirect cause for many of the violations against their rights
we need to understand and be aware of that
incentives during negotiations has to lie in the implementation of the commitments taken by % gapan ] to illiminate nontary of barriers in the areas in various sectors particularly in the & automative sector ]
now is not the time to say let us wait a few more months or we need more concessions now it is the time to launch negotiations with % gapan ]
we cannot accept that our ! two ] way trade with the world ~ third ] largest national economy is only a corter of our trade with the use of % china ]
to ensure this i include that a provision which if the ` pan ] has not delivered on its mtf commitments and has not demonstrated sufficient ambition in meeting the % eu ] 's priority demands the commission should stop negotiations after consultations with the ` european parliament ] and the ` council ]
the commission has estimated that nearly ! two thousand and twenty ] of the % eu ] straight policy would come from potential agreements with the ` us ] and % japan ]
yes @ two days ago ] something happened ! one ] port and the sunner airport were reopened but it is far from being enough
we have to put productive things on a table
i think you struggle and i think you do everything you can but you also have to admit that sometimes some countries are blocking but you also have to admit that sometimes some countries are blocking
pollen are now going to be president so we need to put a maximum pressure on pollen to live up to that responsibility
this is why we cannot wait to talk about @ two thousand and twenty ] this is why it is all very well that we will get a legally binding agreement in @ two thousand and fifteen ] but the couple process needs to create other results long before that
this will only happen if the % eu ] shows direction and to be honest we have not done that @ for @ a few years ]
can i ask you ! one ] ) christian ] commissioner why
it is at the % european union ]
this will only happen if the % eu ] leads
normally we are very polite and i want to mention poland unfortunately because poland has been blocking
i value your work commissioner
it will seriously help us to speed up the pace on negotiations and give the global climate agreement at chance
put this ready map in line with the commission 's own policy and a strategy
mr president the commission has recently provided help to the ` hungarian ] government in order to manage the flows of migrants entering the country
it should at least make sure that the gates are not closed to people that are not having badges
that is called investment
in honger i suppose that in the good old days when they were still running newspaper adds in order to sell their passports the money had to be transferred into an offshore account that apparently belonged to the government of honey
is no past report and no citizenship by investment
there is an incident that is citizenship by identification integration merit belief in what we stand for as nations and as the % european union ]
ms } commissioner ] know that the commission has limited means of action in this but condemned the practice pleased as clearly and as unequivocally as this house does because only then our we go into get the more reluctant money member states to realise that what they do is wrong
unfortunately even the change is introduced by committee do not go far enough in improving the proposal
i am baffled at the notion of extending the term of copy rights whether it is to @ seventy years ] or ninety @ five years ] and i am baffled by it not just because it is jubious and almost out of step with the digital age but also because quite clearly amoved like that will primarily
i believe not withstanding all of the hard work and good will that meps should reject this proposal
it is a proposal which i believe will ultimately reward those articles that are all ready successful and indeed reward the industry
i think the commission needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with the right proposal one that is not just about apporting performers and artists but that in real and practical terms will deliver precisely that
for all ) european ] citizens in general and the ! two ] commitment in particular because they have been numerously targeted on a logical scale
desired to claim the life of a forty two ethnic turkey men and worned on other one
therefore the % eu ] should work closely with the ` european government ] and use all the tools at its disposal to encourage the ) iraqi ] government to provide adequate protection to the ) turkey ] man and other minorities
this resolution is not just for the took mandate it is for all the minority communities of the * europe ] who long for peace and security
@ security ] and protection despite the findings of ) iraq ] 's own high commission for human rights which acknowledge that % turkey ] man have been subjected to terrorism bombing skillablings kid not bings and association neither the federal government of % iraq ] nor the ) curish ] regional government has done enough to provide security and protection
emission limits if no roadmap machinery might not sound like the sexiest subject but it is an important piece of jecks when it comes to tackling airpollutions
the ` un inconvenient truth ] for those who said it argue that the environmental benefits of a ) britain ] outside the % eu ] is that airpollution has an unfortunate habit of not respecting borders
rather than allowing manufacturers to undercut each other in a race to ` libaton ] on environmental standards these ambitious and binding measures of ` anarm ] will ensure industry is manufacturing progressively cleaner engines for these machines which will go a long way to cleaning attoxical political politician in the % eu ]
over ! one third ] of the % uk ] 's airportion is blown in from across the * english channel ]
this proposal is a perfect example of how trade in a common market can also deliver environmental and health benefits for citizens
always suffered quite a lot of delays in many respects and always we wanted to have our ministers lower and higher etc
but now a strict rule of real vision to the future is something that we have to tell the people because this is a truth that our environment is in having danger
the rapporteur is regrettable it is again to the rapporteur
the % eu ] 's cap on banker 's bonesis was challenged by the ) british ] government but largely supported by the ) british ] people just as they support action to make c op p more occasiontable
a survey of members that the institute of directors showed smes felt high pay in some big businesses was harming the reputation of all businesses
so it is greatest directive takes action to improve peach transparency as well as improving many other areas of corporate governance now brexit cannot be used as an excuse for progress on this issue to be ruled back particularly in % britain ]
the % eu ] is paying as almost doubled over @ the last ten years ] while real pay for the average worker has stagnated dealing with this accessive renewation is not anti business
the message of stirective sense must be heeded across the % eu ] and in % britain ] including after # brexit ]
the efforts and costs need in order to implement ` ira ] 's @ seventeen ] which are significant unfortunately the signals will receive from the insurance companies that have started to prepare the implementation of the ` ira ] 's companies as have started to prepare the implementation
mr president the single market is one of the most reliable group bodies for the social institutional democratic supresident the single market is one of the most tangible results of ) european ] integration and yet despite its significant achievements citizens consumers and businesses have become increasingly dissatisfied with it as it often fails to convince consumers and become increasingly dissatisfied
the main problem is done in the everage citizen 's eyes the market is more concerned with vested interests than it is with their needs
we need to start working towards a fairer single market that is politically supported at a conomically viable socially acceptable by ) european ] citizens a market that stimulates sustainable economic growth and drop creation but also considers citizens hopes fears and expectations
the common report is an important step towards achieving a strong and green knowledge based social market economy which by turning its focus back to its people will become a common asset of all its citizens reduce and employment poverty inequalities social exclusion and wage dumping promote respect of fundamental
therefore i urge meps to support the report and in particular the measures aim at endorsing highly competitive social market economy providing consumers with the highest level of protection promoting innovative start ups smes and social economy enterprises opposing abuses in the single market which are trying to circumvent existing rules lower
workers and consumers and consumers and environmental standards highlighting the economic social and environmental benefits and challenges of the sharing economy calling for a single ) european ] system for the protection of geographical indications for non agricultural products and supporting the made in labelling which is of truth and importance to protect consumers and provide them with the information they need
we also count on the ` european parliament ] to make sure that the % eu ] voice is more vitally heart and we appreciate very much the outrage efforts that you have made in the past
in addition to the shared decision for long term action to mitigation and technology and adaptation the identification of appropriate means for financing effective and long term climate policies will be key in the % eu ] further deliberations
with the adoption of this package in @ a few months ] time the % eu ] will demonstrate that its commitment as well as its leadership in the global fight against climate change are as strong as ever
post all also sent the message that the current financial crisis is not to be seen as an obstacle for further action on climate change but its instead as yet another opportunity for transforming profoundly our economic system and moving firmly towards a low carbon economy
of course the % eu ] has repeatedly said that it were not settled for ! twenty ] of them we want to go for ! thirty ] of them and therefore we hope for an ambitious global and comprehensive agreement in % copenhagen ]
! one ] of the key elements of any comprehensive global agreement
as you know the work during the presidency will focus on the international negotiation process
their tireless affords have greatly contributed to us shaping the % eu ] position on climate change
just by the way i am leaving % strasbok ] today flying today discussing with the ) indian ] government and ) indian ] representatives
i have preliminary proposed her a high level meeting with the ` us ] representatives and the % eu ] commission commissioner demands the & czech ] presidency and the upcoming swedish presidency that means draka
the copenhagen conference is now only @ ten months ago ] this did december post not climate conference agreed on a work programme for @ two thousand and nine ] with crearly identified steps towards copenhagen the decision in post non on the open hagen the decision in position lisation of the adoptation fund represents an important step forward in the negotiations on the financing building block
the minister around table in @ post nine ] has also confirmed the shared willingness both the developed and developing countries to find an effective globally agreed response to dangerous climate change for the post @ two thousand and twelve ] period this contains a compassive further mutigation effort adaptation action and finance and technology means to make the trust points operationally this contains an effective global agreed response to make the climate change for the post two thousand and technology means to make the transponse operation
as far as the ` ethnis ] is concerned a single % eu ] cap will with a lineral downward trajectory will be set octioning will be credibly introduced as the method of our cating allowances and moritoring reporting and verification will be strengthened

~ first ] of all let me congratulate through you the ` temporary committee on climate change ] for all the work that has accomplished since its creation in @ april two thousand and eight ] ! seven ] hearings conferences reports resolutions exchanges with ~ third ] parties
in this context i can only rate to rate this committee 's call on the commission and the member states i quote to adopt a pilotary level in the negotiations towards @ eight two thousand and twelve ] agreement and a mediating grow between the position of developed countries in order to ensure by means of a balanced and interest success of the climate negotiation
right at the moment my fears to go beyond concerns about business human rights i fear war and i want to depeace the vision that speaks to this fear
human rights would be no not mother * european ]
therefore i would like to express my gratitude to the founders of the % european ] and the organisation of the price and solute } andrea ] 's acaa for human rights and freedom became an excellent opportunity to talk about human beings and they business rights to years ago i would like to express my gratitude to the founders of the * european ] and the sentence was freedom for the exact meaning of the sentences was according to this friend the message carried by the ` sentences ] was for me to carry the sentence

national so today is the outstanding example of such a situation suddenly enough we can go on massioning many cases of extreme injustice in * iran ] and in many other countries our own world however this is not money and tension today
let me be clear * european ] integration can indeed transform the politics and economics of candidate countries as it has done in my country but it cannot construct democratic legitimacy of state and their institutions
in this respect i am highly appreciative of commissioner } barnier ] 's strong amendment to take into account a citizen 's concerns and observations
in my opinion the single market is not getting the political support and regionally needed to ensure it does not become yesterday 's business
more political leadership on the single market from the presidents of the commission and the ` council ] would go a long way towards achieving a viable single market to serve as a catalyst for economic regovery
we must not lose this political momentum and unique opportunity to provide alise the single market
i repeat that market integration is not an irreversible process and must not be taken for granted
there are not ~ first ] glass and ~ second ] glass countries
but } schengen ] will not be completed and will all members who want to be part of it have the chance to join
they exist only on maps and in the head of those who want to destroy their union
! four hundred million ] nationals of more than ( eur twenty five ] different estates travelling free with no busk port check within a single country this is what ) europeans ] have accomplished and we have to be very proud of it
in this situation a trying to politicise this debate with different issues is a huge mistake ~ first ] because these ! three ] countries are not in the same situation and ~ secondly ] because the accession to & schengen ] cannot be mixsed with the cooperation and berification mechanism
the decision on the accession to & schengen ] must be based on technical criteria and the labelling based on political recents is simply unacceptable
it was already said it is difficult to imagine the % european union ] @ today ] without changing
this is a very tangible expression of our solidarity of the freedom and unity of ) european ] citizens and it brings a lot of economic benefits but not for ) europeans ]
it is about credibility if we as % union ] follow our own rules
~ second ] the economic benefits will bring benefits to all citizens of the % european union ]
instead of wasting money for internal controls we should strengthen through resources in enough financing the external borders of the % union ]
also we often complain that to the european forces populars arguments against the % european union ]
this is one of the cases because it shows injustice to ! two ] many ) european ] citizens and now the ` european council ] has to do its job which is not performed and injustice has to be stopped
are you aware that % united states ] % swedes ] and % germany ] that are true and historic federations they do not have a single national constituency
i am aware that this will be in force the weight of the beek states because it is natural that in the ~ first ] places of each list there will be nationals from the bigger states and this will show provide the position of % ireland ] portugal
this is a quite important
mr president i have ! three ] shudged ! three ] messages one for all colleagues ! one ] for president } tusk ] and the other for the commission and i will be very sharp very loud and very clear
but i am very worried with this idea of an extraordinary ` council ] on the composition of the ` european parliament ] this is a competence in the power of our ` parliament ] that then is to be approved by the ` council ] it is true but we have made a use of progress and i as a professor of constitutional law
the ` council ] should be aware of these in any case
for this reason the % european union ] must pay close attention to the deteriorating human rights situation of the european commitment not only because it is our duty but also because this situation is directly associated with stability in the larger media instrument
the ` european parliament ] resolution adopted on @ fourteen of march last year ] was of welcome step forward but not enough given the current situation @ today ] the cultural religious and economic damage inflicted on the took place inflicted on the ) turkey ] member states is still highly visible and cannot be ignored by the % european union ] we should not forget all the incidents which took place in the & city of horizo ] and
bending conditions
over @ many years ] the agency has demonstrated its capacity to provide education health relieve and social services
the other one the ) european ] defence fund
the % european union ] is known as a soft power and this identity should be preserved and developed
i would like to stress that the intention to have more than ( eur five billion ] * europe ] a year for this fund requests on resources for the % european union ]
corruption is not just a private matter that is why we have to push governments and political and social bodies to fight for themselves against their internal structural corruption
things are not in line with those high standards in some or many of our member states women do not know how many
and it is really very difficult to come into solution without knowing where these borders and what are the guarantees to assets those waters so that we really can say our citizens yes we have the high standards
we much commission and the ` council ] to provide us with this kind of clear knowledge what we mean by national security
we should continue to invest our efforts to guarantee the implementation of the existing tools and the full use of % eu ] and initiated to the fight against cyber streads
but we should also continue an intensify work to provide for new and more comprehensive responses to the consently of overwing challenges posed by this threat
the ` council ] remains fully committed to war constictively towards adoption and effective implementation of concrete measures in that respect
today the presidency and the ` european parliament ] received key impute from the commission on its recommendations for the most challenging issues in the directive regarding scope and several aspects of implementation that really instrumental in making the last remaining strong
with this directive the % eu ] is going into unchurted territory in attempting to make our new digitalise more safe and secure
this is admittedly not an easy process as developing legislation on a highly technical issue that touched at the same time on national security is no easy task the legislative presidency continues and will continue to work to make significant progress on this file by the end of join
we shall also continue our efforts towards introducing effective and creative practical preventive and control measures that will go beyond the necessary legislative minimum
dramatic changes in the * media ] and % sk ] in particular the introduction of new technologies have resulted in an unprecedented flow of him of information
despite recognient measures nisa total territorial regimes nor terrorists are able to firmly close the tep and fully prevent the information flow
media serve as a caterolist for a rapid and effective global response and thus is which was a survival of a democratic society
mr president i would like to thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs because this negotiation procedure has not been a traditional i want this you want that let us meet in the middle mid the middle mid the middle eastern president and i would like to say
this report will then have a financial instrument that will make it profitable for ship owners to scrap their ships legally
there has been a massive law being campaign against this proposal by the report but it is actually based on incorrect information
the money collected will go back to the sector if they follow the law
they have been warning against huge administrative burdens why the impact assessment said that it is a very efficient administrative way to deal with this problem
so please support these financial instruments amendment ! thirty one ] and ! thirty two ] so we can negotiate with the ` council ] who stands ready to negotiate with us
this will require proactive interventions by member state governments
free market theology must not stand in the way of doing right by workers
so is the common refrain that we must learn the lessons of this economic crisis genuine
if it is then the case for fundamental change in % eu ] policy and indeed % eu ] treaties is now unanswerable and should be the stop of the % uk ] 's old deliberation
we need a new treaty for a new time
so i call on the ` council ] to act according to legislation according to the monetary
mr president new technologies are rapidly changing the nature of the financial interest
this presents massive opportunities for * europe ] and it is now up to us policy makers to make the right choices and create a conducive environment so that * europe ] can benefit to the full extent
& finski ] is often used to refer to a specific seen of start up disrupting finance with innovation
this definition is not a one used in our report because it would exclude a large amount of relevant actors
instead financing finance finance in able by new technologies covering the whole range of financial services products and infrastructure
it also includes intertech the use of new technologies in ensurance and rackeck the application of new technologies for regulatory compliance the current rise of financing comes at the origination of a number of different technological developments within a short time spend
namely artificial intelligence cloud computing and disrebuted legitimal technology
these provide new opportunities for disruptions like mulbal payments open banking crowd funding cripped up currencies and robe of advice
financing can lead to significant benefits such as cost reductions efficiency gains and more transparency
it can be also an effective tool for financial inclusion opening up high level services for those who could not afford them before
furthermore financing can enable cross border financial flows and infrastructure through alternative lending and investment channels
the financial revolution that we are currently experiencing is global
the bulk of these investments was made in the % united states ] and also ` asia ] and % israel ] are gearing up in this respect
the us china and % israel ] has more than ! half ] of the top ten largest financial companies
if * europe ] wants to remain competitive rapid innovation should be the norm not the acception
this is not only important for * europe ] 's financial infrastructure but also for the real economy with consumers and businesses benefiting from improved financial services
notwithstanding all the benefits financial also confronts us with essential questions of irregulatory societal nature
consumer protection and the stability of the financial system should be key concerns in this regard
together with the competitiveness of the ` european economy ] they make for the core priorities of this report
the report does not intend to give technical solutions
however it does intend to pose the right questions
that should be a first step in the process of creating a forward looking ) european ] policy in the area of financial technologies
the intention of this report is not to propose specific legislative actions
we must be cautious with creating new rules because much is still unclear about future developments of financial technologies
the better point of departure is investigating where current legislation causes uncertainties or barriers and identifying where additional action is necessary
doing this purposefully requires a holistic approach as technological development in our digitising society call for breaking silons
financial already breaking silons themselves
aften they offer products in a diverse multi party conjunction
i have some ministers left at the end i will use the time then
i would like to go on with any kind of digital services we have to have very strong common simple understandable data protection regulation
i very much hope that in cooperation between the commission and ` parliament ] we can make also clear to the ` council ] that the package of data protection is crucial for development of digital single market
roma people have been suffering all through the ) european ] history but also the situation has never been better
they we have an opportunity to give prosperity to all of the people of * europe ]
in your reply and do not continue to attack the people that are moving prosporters
in addition with the implementation of a harmonised ) european ] approach making these websites accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable business
the directive now covers all % eu ] public sectors bodies websites and websites providing public services as laid down in a new ) annex ]
this directive is essentially a forerunner in the plant ) european ] excessibility act which i know is also being eagerly awaited by our citizens
the specifications for the accessibility are technology neutral and based on the international web content accessibility guidelines
in our increasing the digital world accessibility is very much a human right all people are entitled to use the internet in order to exercise their fundamental rights
less than ! one ] third of * europe ] 's public sector and government websites and even as the intent percent of * europe ] 's websites in general are fully accessible
however despite the fact that assisting technology already exists * europe ] has been legging far behind
in * europe ] this amounts to ( eighty million ] citizens with disabilities and another ! eighty seven million ] aged over ( eur sixty five one hundred and sixty seven million ] to ) great ] a number to be ignored throughout my envolvement with ` stoty ii ] i have seen what these people face went trying to nevigate their way online it was particularly i was particularly struck by the difficulties faced by the bline it was particularly i was particularly held in @ april two thousand and fifty face ] which was exemplified at an import committee hering held in @ april two thousand and sixty five ]
we are the % european union ] we should be setting the agenda not struggling or even fading keep to keep up
making websites and their content usable for all should have already become a priority at % eu ] level
this piece of legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited by both citizens with disabilities and our increasing ageing population who find themselves more and more isolated and excluded from a world where information is accessible primarily online
the ` imca committee ] was more ambitious and made a number of significant amendments to the text
i am sure the ) greek ] presidency will follow up the goodwork on this file it is completely feasible that the ) italian ] presidency will be able to bring this dossier into legislation
the scope along with the enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems reflects the binding obligations set out in the % un ] on the rights of persons with disabilities and the commitments made in the digital agenda for * europe ]
the financial benefits are currently estimated at ! two billion ]
however i thank commissioner } coulas ] for having openly supported our legislative work using one of the most modern ways of rapid communication
however this is only the first step in the legislative process we regret the lack of engagement of previous presidencies on this dossier
it is both an atheically show and a commercial issue
it is about basic and fundamental human rights and it is about jobs
in the speech you said that after @ a year of work ] in another country the country in which % africa ] worker had worked should be financially responsible for the payment of unemployment benefits
the guiding principle behind this is that a fronture worker should receive benefits from the country in which he or she has contributed
this is fair for everybody you said
i completely agree with this principle therefore commissioner i would like to ask you to night if you think that this principle should receive benefits from the country in which the ` ecr ] has contributed should apply for not only frontier workers but all mobile workers within the % eu ] thank you
mr president you mention that there are differences between the countries in use and employment
the aim is to undermine the work of legislators such as us and at the same time misleased consumers
leaving ( millions of frozen ] cars on our roads more than @ two years ] after the ` decelgate scandal ] and our committee work in this ` parliament ]
in our economy mrs } commissioner ] and in our society no private company no sector they may be the largest they may have a lot of people working there but none of them should be allowed to be allowed to be an end to act as they do today as they carr industry does today because they think themselves of their
they would follow your order and receive migrants and refugees in my country in my country my honoury you as well as every single person in this room know perfectly well that those people would not want to stay in hongery because they want a better life
what is the order so to say in this respect
all know very well that we cannot put these people into like close institutions
they have the right to freedom of movement
i know we should integrate them
this is the only gance and this is a role gance and the ) mister timmer ] and the equality because they would not like to be integrated in hongery they would like to move on the next day to reach a country so you must have a strategy about the treatment of the migrant crisis
we are in the position to pledge a ) european ] government more to open up
implementation and enforcement are fundamental for our future
a good application of you } lawys ] vaccine in order to regain the support of our citizens and increase the efficiency of our monetary % union ]
we are talking about more integration
there are @ two thousand and eleven ] energy port on iceland clearly demonstrates % iceland ] 's advanced level of preparation the closure of @ eight ] negotiationship that is most welcome by the challenging necessary authorities are yet to come and i am in heard of checked aspicious risks and agriculture which will need special attention given that circumstances in iceland are different from those of other ) european ] countries
greater importance should also be given to negotiations on chapters such as original policy the environment and the economic and monetary policy i saw that according to the recent pole the majority of ice land as still opposed % eu ] membership since @ sixty seven ] are against and only ! thirty three ] in favour of accession but my remark is that in the last year to support for the % eu ] and both counterdate and member states has been very low and therefore iceland should continue to remain commit it to the recent pole the majority of accession to support for the % eu ] and the member states has been very low and therefore is that in the last year of accession to the external report
legislator defined both manitary information and voluntary information for good consumers making information across your point of the legislation
it is critical that consumers have access to complete information in order to make an informed choice
the resolution of the fisheries committee discusses the commission survey from control of @ two thousand and fifteen ] which analyses the conformity of labelling with the legal requirements of wide fishing retail
however numbers are worrying for some species for which the level of conformity is very low common species are substituted for more expensive species
it could help in the creation of an external structure which scrutinises the sertification of voluntary claims including on the label of fishery and aquicultural products
i would also like to remind the commission that ` parliament ] is still awaiting the commission report on the possibility of define and establishing minimum criteria for the creation of an % eu ] % eu ] equally blocked fisheries and equical traducts
further information of fish can be added to a label as an addition to compulsory information
member states must implement sanctions which are efficient proportionate and despative
compulsory and correct information must be available for consumers all the way through the chain including dinors and restrance
it deals with voluntary information on fishery products and aims at creating and up to date an exhaustive informatory of voluntary claims associated with the fishery and equicalture products which are marketing in the % european union ] whatever their origin
the commission is currently working on the implementation of a pilot project proposed by ` parliament ] @ last year ] and my regards to our chair vis } de keyco ] could not be here today
this inventory will enable an analysis of the certification systems of these claims
it is also necessary that such information be reliable meaning it must be controlled in a very strict manner
this information can able consumers to have complementary information such as data of catch data of landing more information of fishing gear the flagstate information on the naturitional value of the product environmental ethical or social information
in a separate study from @ last year on labelling ] in % russia ] 's including the % eu ] cantines the end of % oshana ] estimates mr } labelling ] at ~ thirty two ] overall with a mislabling rate in blue fintuna to be ! eighty ] of this observation brings us to ask member states to enforce the existing law
~ first ] and foremost member states have to reinforce controls in order to identify fraud and the missing links in the supply chain for fishery and agriculture products which lead to mislabelling or fraud
it is the duty of member states to guarantee that this information is available and accurate
we are waiting this external structure and hope that this information will be easily accessible to consumers
the publication of this report is a requirement of the common market organisation for fishery and acquished regulation
this is often the case for blue fintuna
compulsory information is the following commercial designation of species and its scientific name the production method and fishing gear the area where the product was caught or produced and the clear indication where the product was defrosted this mandatory information applies both to retail and supply for cators and restronts
restrance must always keep the information which they received when they both the product in case consumers or state authorities ask for them
i think we need to promote public awareness and online safety especially among children but also with parents so that they know exactly what is going on what can be done on the internet
it is a wonderful source of information for all of us and it is something that is going to be part of our lives into the future however there are those who pray on children and they will use the international and much as they possibly can to try and undermine children
i think member states should work together to introduce a network of contact points for the public to reach a report illegal and powerful content and conduct
if i could turn to activity based budgetary and management i in the commission has made huge progress on this but i would warn against over pro cratising this exercise because what we want to ensure that quality tickling boxes
it will allow us to get a much clearer idea of our policy perspectives on top of the commission 's annual work programmes
mr president out of this budget review we simply after ask ourselves ! one ] question does the budget reflect the political priorities of the @ twenty five century ] if it does not in each changing
is it flexible enough to reflect changing times
we do not want people to spend all their time invaluating themselves when they should be getting on and doing some work
we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the mff
now it is about university it is about angels it is about angels it is about the next national consultation
we have witnessed an attempt and attempt a vague idea to reintroduce the death penalty and all that comes from a man who is constantly referring to ) christian ] values
the only thing that comes to mind to me in all this context is if all foreign influences so bad why do you accept the payment of ( eur five billion ] and euros as the big natural sippient of ) european ] structural funds in order to plastic the whole country with the posters in which you call % brussels ] crap
somebody who does that for a minister leave the % union ] out of their own accourt
we have witnessed several unspeakably worded national consultations in the meantime
the angel think prime minister is not about transparency as we all know it is in order to lead to lead those who are foreign funded as foreign because they might carry foreign influences to hungry and foreign influences bad
it escapes me from a minister where the death penalty would be on any ) christian ] agenda and i have really found any ) christian ] ) philogians ] who would have been able to find anything good about the death penalty
when it was @ the last time amelion ] people marched through the streets of the ` european capital ] demanding more % eu ] integration
it is also a moment of truth for our policy in the eastern neighbourhood and i would dare to the biggest stesticate of the % eu ] spare for months as a geopolitical actor capable of defending its interests and values in the immediate neighbourhood
i fully share the ` parliament ] 's sense of urgency to make progress on this proposal
i therefore welcome the proposal of the budget committee of the ` european parliament ] which proposes to restore most of the appropriations proposed by the commission in the draft budget
@ two thousand and fifteen ] we cannot afford the % eu ] budget being paralised we need to bring it under control and we have at this moment a unique opportunity to do so
i fully agree that we must act responsibly and address at this place the needs that we have in payments
however even if indeed further reinforcement contribute to increasing investments we should try and find the right balance within the implementation prospects and the payments of all ability
we should seize such opportunity to address the shortage of payments appropriations
all this has to be achieved within very time financial circumstances and very tied budgetary sellings
we must also honour our obligations and pay outstanding bills teaming from past commitments thus avoiding unnecessary burden on beneficiaries
sustainable economic growth competitiveness the creation of jobs and the fight against use on employment are over argent priorities of the % eu ] policy and should be reflected in the orientation of the & eu ] expenditure for @ two thousand and fifteen ] we must do this under a clear and agreed framework and provide a necessary predictability and security for our investment and our partners
must put all our efforts in making this framework for the operation on full respecting all the terms of this agreement
@ two thousand and fifteen ] @ last month ] i expressed before this house the commission concerned about the position taken by the ` council ] in its reading of the budget @ two thousand and fifteen ] the budget
an exceptional additional revenue from financing infrastrumming from the enforcement of the competition policy means that the additional payment requests for @ two thousand and fourteen ] will be in total at no cost for member state
the level of payment appropriations remains to permanent concern that we need to address at this point at consolidation we must ensure that the legal obligations arising in @ two thousand and fifteen ] are met and put a stop to their snowboll effect of shifting and ever increasing amount of unpaid views into future years
we must avoid our deficient under budgeting in the future as we are now aware of the problems that such an approach brings
the reinforcement of payment appropriations proposed by the commission in @ amending eleberate letter no one ] goes in the same direction as a number of amendments proposed by the ` european parliament ] where the needs are most pressing and imparticularly in particular with the aim of reducing the backlock of anti builds and allowing the proper lounching of the new programmes
in its draft budget the commission has proposed to use the full amount of payment appropriations under the & amff silving for two thousand and fourteen ]
as you know favourable developments on the revenue side in @ two thousand and fourteen ] providing a portunity to find agreement in this direction
i have been mind for example the % eu ] coverance of mayors which has been contributed to our climate and energy objectives in
this is indeed where regions and cities should be when it comes to finding solutions for climate change mitigation and adoptation they have proved to be ambitious for our looking and innovative so we need all of them on board
there will be no place for business as usual
i think it is very important
adoption is a wonderful alternative for otherwise on wanted children or a child that left in an unsafe environment
but what concerns me about this report is that it is another power group vibrants over the jurisdiction of family law
in the % uk ] there are strict laws about family courts including the privacy of proceedings for what is and always will be a very emotive subject
but what i fear with this latest demand for more * europe ] is the best interest of the child may be put second to the % eu ] 's desire for more and more power
and what happens if it is a disabuled dispute to the adoption
if the grand parents want to adopt
or ! one ] parent is actually fighting the case
how will that work if the child is taken across another country 's border another culture or maybe where the child will be brought up speaking a different language
i believe that we all should be encouraging families to be strong and cohesive units which is the best environment for bringing up a child show
i am probably much more important politically disagreed with that just witness the political maddling in the & brexit ] process or a number of ) european ] general elections so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider and this is not an issue for nators eastern flank this is a larger play that we need to deal with the sector
the report makes reference and emphasises rightly and the security defends and political challenge that % russia ] approvides for the % european union ]
much as i would like to avoid this we cannot simply support this fight as it stands now
obligation for bilateral individual response but we member state
it is very much very much
i do not think i need to remind my honourable colleagues that that particular article is not traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response
but they will do so only when ) ukrainians ] manage to fill fill on the % ukraine ] and outstanding conditions
i believe that our common goal is to help % ukraine ] but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation
a step into the right direction is the adoption of the law on high and the corruption court is last week
@ two thousand and fourteen ] this time the commission proposes ( eur one billion ] to be dispersed as medium and long term loans
~ third ] to reform process which has been important but is not really steadied and ill now
therefore it is crucial that a too unfailed anti corruption measures will be part of the new conditions
this memorandum sets out the supporting policy measures which are conditional for the dispursements of the funds
tell me said to address any doubts that may arise during @ this debate ] efsf is not an unconditional support
~ first ] to personing conflict and casualities into eastern future aim and to halt every socioeconomic consequences of this aggression
~ second ] to the economic recovery which remains fraudule
if corruption is not addressed dressed dressed and dressed dressed dressed sickly and i fair fund should not be delivered to % ukraine ]
in that context i would like to i like to kee elements
there are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve to the economic civilisation and to support the reforms no it is very important to remind that the commission can stand to last transfer to & turkey ] and ` emf air ] programme when some new crains commitments were not fulfilled
in addition to newly adopted claw was signed @ yesterday ] by the president of % ukraine ] i welcome the rapporteur 's welcomes this news with great satisfaction and it means that % ukrainian ] stake to commit men seriously
the assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in % ukraine ] which is done by ukraining with the % ukrainian ] authorities a memorandum of understanding
hence could need for support to these reforms into contexts where many interests can play against especially in a pre election years
in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation this is a first time that the commission proposals and mff if for % ukraine ] since the beginning of tomorrow in
if we are serious about our goal we cannot slow down to procedures
i am very grateful that we are where we are now indeed % ukraine ] needs this report and it deserves this support and i think it is very appropriate to have this next programme now
it is not included indeed a joint declaration you explicitly refer to that because that it is what it is also about
we need to be very clear in this regard
however the return of the crucial issue remains that of the implementation
mr president you cannot save your money and spend it you cannot have your quick and ate it you cannot pretend to be a nation when you are going to be a nation when you
the % european union ] despite what it likes to think is not a nation
it follows that it cannot be and should not be applied to such international agreements this wants and many others
happily we have the perfect opportunity to play it and play it repeatedly
we the % united kingdom ] are permanent members of the % united nations ] security ` council ] we must not give this out quite crunched countries that we must stand to make better use of it
this manage using its tool pause block and even vator behaviour on international trades conventions and agreements which are against our interest there is a clear % uk ] message here for the % european union ] you think you have had all the cards
you do not damn 's
our handle is potentially a lot better than you understand
what the % uk ] has to do however is to understand itself how good our handers and then be prepared to use it
if the ) british ] government is worth anything at all those who play hard both with us should and i hope well find that we can play hard both with them
it could form the blueprint for radical change yet without decreasing funding going to new member states i have called for the % uk ] government to include these open * europe ] proposals in their reform and renegotiation discussions we are talking about a third of the % eu ] 's total budget
quite difficult to explain briefly but it is about not shuffling money around from one country to another and not particularly that large ) eu ] recyption countries give money to the commission that the commission then gives them back and tells them what to do
rather it is focusing on countries like yours and situations like yours so that cohesion achieves sustainable economic growth and let people out of that situation for the benefit of everybody within the % eu ] on a limited basis not forever
it will be an unnecessary collection of much of information about travellers who are completely innocent
we have to delay the data after the excellent and less there is the risk of the suspicion so what we expect from the common ) canadian ] authorities with regard to our citizens we should also respect with regard to citizens of other citizens of other citizens like % canada ]
we are not fixing the system which is not working because some of the member states authorities are not sorrowly working with the system feeding into a information to the system some of the ortugal borders
we have to check the past points and that is exactly what we are doing
this system you do not get track of any vis over % vester ] in the % european union ]
stop benching hongering stop preaching us about solidarity and talking about solidarity to those strong healthy young ) syrian ] and other men who should go home and rebuild their countries
but at the same time you know that people are tired of words and promises and it is time for action from the commission as well and the strongest tool which you possess is a commission is the project that the draft of your budget for the next multiannual financial framework we should stop thinking how to reduce the % european ] budget
i look for own resources
we should really focus on political priorities and the measure priority is how to move from * europe ] of divergence in equalities towards * europe of convergence ] and strong economic growth and social justice
this means that life all people in * europe ] is better and this is what people expect from us or this is what people expect from us or this means that life all people in * europe ] is
i agree and i appreciate it
in some cases a strategic of legality would only be a starting point the ~ first ] measure included in the due deliversion procedure
~ firstly ] i would like to refer to the due dealings and approach which is more comprehensive than just a set of legality
when the risk assessment concerns that the country of origin of all its impresent higher risk of administrative corruption or in countries where enforcement of national rules is weak additional guarantees are necessary to underpin the & certified legality ]
the principle of good deligence reflects the legal obligation of a proactive behaviour to accept and legality and needs to be demonstrated on a basis of comprehensive measures which will enable legality to be regionally assured
we should keep in mind that patterns of topical differentiation are the result of the interaction of a number of different factors which vary in importance in different locations
in the % european union ] we understand that % guarantee ] on the coherence of our policies must go handing cand with supporting cantries in their efforts to strengthen national and local institutions and make progress towards effective governance and use of orients resources i lose thank again
i am encouraged that ` parliament ] while endorsing the approach of the commission wants to reinforce it further and has made amendments to this end
i also want to assure you that the commission will give careful consideration to the amendments of the proposed regulation
this is what they mean
moreover we will investigate any barriers that may prevent consumers from such into better offers
the ` european ] also single market for the deal financial services which can rely on innovative solution its very welcome
a high level of imbalance and production is of course of the highest priority for the commission
the developing countries have delivered the wealth and for a roadmap to legal binding lobal agreement
i think that when it comes to such sensitive topics we cannot afford to classify them into strict categories such as % eu ] internal and % eu ] external issues because terrorist actions might be plent outside the % eu ] but can seriously affect the people living inside the % eu ]
you are not proverty reducing an equality decent work
so let me conclude
for the future of our planet and for the future of our planet and for the future of our people
you could say well in time to fake news it is good to have done
therefore reaching the sustainable development goals within the % eu ] is vital
it says that we are making progress we are moving in the right direction
mr president international energy agency just recently publish the report saying that the developed countries of this world the industrialised countries have about @ five years ] to change fundamentally they wait a produce energy and they wait a consumer energy
in order for us to stay below a ! two ] degree increase in temperature
now if we do not stay below trude agrees we know what we will happen
then if we look at what has actually now been pledged by the same countries the countries that need to change fundamentally within @ five years ] it is unfortunately very very dissatisfying them if we look at what has actually now been pledged by the same countries the countries that need to change fundamentally within @ five years ] it is unfortunately very very very dissatisfied
we see this integration now with a pledge of about ! half ] of what we need in order to reach our target
we all know that we will not get a full legally binding agreement that would regard some education in % gerban ] which will solve these problems but we know also that we have possibilities to pursue targets that are ambitious none the less targets that will get accust closer to our final goal
this is why we have a moral obligation to help them financially
that is colder here now is also quite predictable because if the golf stream is pressed down by melt water from the & arctic ] this is an explainable effect
it has to do with a very important argument on democracy
capital scores problems inside member states in national transport
now we are limiting it to @ two days ] per member state and it will be posing from the one nobody driving driving drivers have a new horizon to go back home by the end of @ maximum three weeks ]
we are ending the drivers misuse and labour books companies
for the ~ first ] time common strong enforcement is possible by using the latest technology available in italy if it does not transport its posting from the one colleague woting against can go back home and their trivers that indefinitely be paid
if i know that confront destination meets in % medium ] waste
this is too vice to meet
you need to understand what it means through the universally applicable collective agreements if you oppose the mandate
minimum greatness might begun a new norm and used it all to be aware of that
currently we do not have a common % eu ] minimum weights level in transport and the posing of trivers directive is not the right to do that
it is totally unadopted as costs
we need a reach content of information and to facilitate access to information which could improve our lives and lead to concrete economic growth
we should have a better guarantee and have a better look on the additionality
there we have to support these countries to have a better capacity to take it quality to make projects and investment banks as micro leakers said
it has to do with a very important argument on democracy
all extensive skies is no longer that added to this shelter political woman
this should be immediately in a conditional release on humanitarian governance
it is now a matter of human competition
capital scores problems inside member states in national transport
we are all meeting it @ today ] 's permission from the one
nobody driving drivers have a new horizon to go back home by the end of maximum three weeks
we are ending drivers misuses and let the books companies
for the ~ first ] time comment strong enforcement is possible by using the latest technology available
if it does not announce any transport it is posting from the euro and colleague wating against can go back home and their drivers that interfeder they might not drive better national salaries anymore instead they could be paid for a final country destination meaning and weights
this is too wide streamed
you need to understand what it means to the universally applicable collective agreements if you oppose to mandate
minimum greatness might begun a new norm and you should all be aware of that
currently we do not have a common % eu ] minimum weights level in transport and the posing of trivers directive is not the right to do that
} data no gallistia ] was known internationally was known globally for a fight against corruption and she reported on the corruption
multi ease jographically and historically ! one ] of the gates and ! one ] of the targets of the % european union ]
she reported on the penal market and we have seen a red we have heard and we could not ignore penal papers are directly implicated with some multi authorities
it should be the basic of the protection of human rights rule of law independence of sudicial power and impassion of criminal prosecution
to the commission and to the ` mautis ] authorities is to grant respect and observation of the rule of law
but the similar concern and wish for dialogue in the election to spend is not shown by the ) european ] institutions in spite of having their more than strong signals of breaches of the rule of law of democracy and of fundamental rights
point ! five ] expresses confirms about the rule of law democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of dominion and independence of the police in judiciary
the commission the other half in example
i am ashamed and we all should be ashamed because we thought this killing we would never know here what happens in % malta ] % journalist ] being aras denounced and even guilt media houses being blackmade by banks suspected of money laundering and tax evasion
high government of fisheries suspected of being implicated also in the same operations and police authorities refusing to investigate those allegations because they have been appointed by and have economic and personal disability government
we cannot remain silent so today we ask for ! three ] concrete actions ~ first ] we want the commission to immediately launch a rule of low dialogue with % martin ]
~ second ] we want democratic authorities to investigate and to persecute many laundering no matter the names or the organisations implicated
on ~ third ] we want an independent and international investigation into the killing of definite caroon against % europe ] we have to say low and clear that * europe ] values and principles are much more important than many
* europe ] is about justice about separation of powers and
they know they know she is
* europe ] is also about freedom transparency and truth
the legislation to implement beyond our has been submitted to our ` parliament ] and is being discussed in our house
the taxation is a key element of the political systems and our democracies and in a treaty they are therefore part and i believe rightly show part of the member state 's competences
that is why we have to work on this
i did not mention in my speech but the same pay for the same work in the same type of circumstances is at a core of the belief of the death government
there can be no doubt and i am happy that i know that a whole commission is behind us
maybe not for you personally but this is happening at the moment
yes we are working on new alliances with the % eu ]
thanks to the few markets ! hundreds of millions ] of people in the @ last ten fifty years ] have been lifted out of poverty worldwide
we are granting for granting our reform
our defence it is crucial to keep the dialogue with the % united states ] going even if within that family relationship we have some serious quarrels at the moment
we have to do this collective
as we all know the ) firm ] is disagreed and that helps to debate also in those areas
you have this big house here
union and i am absolutely convinced that in those days she will fully agree with what i have just stated
~ secondly ] on migration i hear @ today ] reach out my hands to % italy ] because i know they have to deal with an extremely difficult situation
mr president i was all for participating in this debate
i am absolutely convinced that we cannot just say that our new tasks which have to be funded and at the same time we cannot find safety in the existing budget and that is the play i am making here there is exactly what all the member states have to do and just say what all the member states have to do and just say in what all the member states have to do and just say
i cannot answer all of them but i have tried to bring them back to basically for key issues
this is also my answer to mr } bartier ] on this issue better guarding our borders and working on better return mechanisms for rejected osynmes
but i also eagerly await the ) italian ] government 's national measures because they have to do a lot to better manage the influence of illegal markets and then they know that they stand ready to show solidarity and also as a % european union ] to work collectively to address this issue which will be with us for the years and to come
i believe social affairs have to state that national level but when social affairs have a cross border impact than also * europe ] meets together involved
we also have to remain focused and this is crucial on structural reforms
that is time that the ` council ] fingers not at those who act like the new ) government ] in % spain ] but to those who do not act
number to the question cannot be externalised and the answer cannot be simply repressive
we holistic and preventive
but then you have to explain us how these is competible this general external % european union ] with an internal deal with an % european union ]
this is not sustainable
and let me put a final question do you really believe that one percent of burden of burden of ( one ] of the gdp is the fast track the beak way for the big government of ) european ] institutions
these reasonable
! eight ] of all the new jobs in the % european union ] have been created by smes and my own constituency of doubling about ! four hundred ] ! zero ] people are employed by about ! one hundred ] ! zector ]
we have at the moment is about jobs jobs jobs and we must bend over backwards to try and protect existing employment and hopefully in the years ahead trying to reate new jobs
that is absolutely essential for all of us
if we want to get our small businesses and get employment and to stabilise in the % european union ] and in our each individual member state we must do everything we possibly can to try and save them
we must do all we possibly can at the moment to support these companies in difficult times
the sectors most affected are mining extractive industries agriculture business who through electric demt and water rights and logging
@ two thousand and fifteen ] in @ two thousand and sixteen ] there were around ! four ] murders provide and this murderous strength went on in this year
the % eu ] and its member states are clearly not doing enough to ensure cooperate accountability and legal redress
this annual report concludes includes strong language on the stringing space for civil society including the call for an % eu ] monitoring mechanism for cases of violations of freedom of assembly and association
invites mental human rights defenders like her and a threat when they oppose the interest of cooperations and governments
honger where one can witness cronism and its finance is a perfect example to demonstrate this problem
~ first ] in traduction of targeted measures against dividuals responsible for grave human rights violations and ~ second ] providing active support for ) syria ] 's society groups and defenders of human rights i have played here to extend over simplify and support for % european union ] people who have since ended a last year
this is coming back to us after a successful conclusion of the negotiations and i would like to thank the rapporteurs and the commission also for its assistance in facilitating this deal which actually put demands on facilities so that the practice known as beaching is not any more possible and that is a great step forward
when you look at the situation in % greece ] it is difficult
of course a lot of the things in that agreement between the % union ] and the member states and % turkey ] are have to be dealt with and have to be labourated on and adopted individual aspects will of course when it is legally about to be dealt with with the proper institutions
the border will not be opening again
we need to work full speed on a ) european ] more regard system on a revision of doublin and on a more structural ) european ] solutions
the solution is an outline of possible solutions and it is a beginning of the implementation in the hard work that has been done and has to be done
the ` uk ] decided survive being at sea so you have to engage with the other country on the other side you have to engage with countries on the other side of the external borders so agreement with % turkey ] was necessary in any case
there are things to be built up from scretch
overseeing improvements we are seeing improvements for seeing positive effects already but we also realise that our lot has to be done
we are greek governments doing what they can at to help and member states are supporting it
a part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part
one thing has to be clear there only solution is to apply for asylum in % greece ] get into that system and offer themselves up for relocation
in our position not an agreement within the legal meaning of & article two hundred and eighteen ] of the treaty
it offers us new challenges and more manageable than the old ones that we have to face @ last year ] but they are still challenges and they still lead to a lot of work and a lot of improvement that we are doing under day by day and weak basis
it is fully clear that they have a right to be heard if a right to be heard they have a right to an appeal they are protested regularly regularly real
and the dead as happens and a lot of work has been done in practice to improve applied to the people in the reception of activities and also get this new system of readmission started
we are also combining it with getting more of a grip on who is coming to the ) european ] member state for protection and who is offered protection in the region and in % turkey ]
where debt there is a risk of other roots and we have to work hard on finding solutions to prevent those roots from leading to a large influxt posing member states would love for issues and most horribly put having their lives a great risk again and
we also commend the hard work being done on the ) turkish ] side for improving the situation of the refugees they have harboured a harbour ( millions ] there as well as the legal safeguards and the legal position of those people who is improved by % turkey ] which helps us enormously in them make it disagreement work and have a better solution that we had before
see improvements everyday but we fully realise as member states and as the ` council ] that we are not there yet and the latter has to be done
i think that is the biggest benefit we can already see from this agreement
of course other member states have to do a lot as well as well as we do a lot as well
let me say from the ` council ] perspective and the member states perspective this is not a perfect solution but it is the best solution that we can find right now
fortunately it seems to me that we are not undervated reduced this unsustainability
% brexit ] is an unfortunate reality but we have to move on
we i think i should refresh that most of us believe in a future * europe ] to top holes the fundamental value of solidarity on issues like migration and in a * europe ] that strives to guarantee the safety and security of its citizens
we must use a basic plot for death to principles respect for human rights and dignity freedom equality and rule of law
any progress registered on the future of * europe ] must be followed up and translated into action
having spent almost @ nine years ] more self in this institution i know how crucial and meaningful ` parliament ] 's continued strong and participation is in this defining moment for the future shaping of the % european ] project colleagues we need to draw and dismonmentum and cover industry monetary better union
we believe that success belongs to dose who can harness positive forces that unite rather than devide
the current indicators show that we have once against started to reduce their successors we believe that the % union ] should be robastly positioned to shape and manage by their globalisation not mirally reactivated
this could pave the way for the eventual arrovance of the unity
a strong * europe ] is needed to bring about right balance in a word order which is shifting
some options will me seem to be more attractive than others and who know there may be other options which have not yet been brought to the table
we must face up to the reality that the ) european ] 's horizons have shifted
having said that reform does not mean a whole redesign of * europe ]
we have a fregile balancing act to follow a balance between flexibility which is not so lose as to threaten the meaning of a real union and intransident regidity which would undermine the whole process of the % european ] project
we believe in creating better conditions for growth jobs and for higher living standards through the % union ] single market
these are the values that reflect the sole of the % union ] and form the court of any future * europe ]
yes we are living in times of extraordinary and predictability and it would be a big mistake to underestimate the major settlemate set back set back set back set back sentence but it would be an even bigger mistake to fall into a maggade negative minority and resign ourselves to doing nothing
the % european union ] is not about % brussels ] it is not about % strasbourg ] nor is it about institutions which many of us involved in @ today ] 's debate belong
never has there been a more important time for member states and institutions to remain united never has there been a crucial time for all of us to focus on the big picture and shut out potentially distracting unnecessary divisive issues
it is nothing in common with the democracies of * europe ] and their forth take should ever ever be allowed to join the % european union ]
but they were men and women of their time as it is a treaty of its time
because what began as a noble economic plan has moved into a political monster egged on by successive euro crats who are hongry for ever more power and determined to destroy the nation state
what continues to amaze me is that you never lend
you talk about an existential crisis but you say what is neither livel nor % eu ] you are fiddling whilst the treaty of rhome berns so what i will say is simply this i urge you to caution when you are celebrating @ next week ] because % brexit ] could trigger a footcape whereby all that countries leave that same treaty you are celebrating @ next week ]
to ` dovid ] esac and his family i just want to say that you have many friends in this ` parliament ] and we will not stay silent and till the day dovid ` esac ] is back home in % sweden ] in safety
dreaming and peacefully acting for democracy must never be a crime
@ for nineteen years ] his wife and his children have tried to do everything they can to get human released
it is something rating a rating a rating in a world when people can be dealt and in worse cases we deprive their lives just because they dream of a better society a better world
mr president ~ first ] information went to thank on my colleagues for a good cooperation that has made these resolutions possible and urgency that talks about real people 's lives because oppression and injustice are not only words
multiluterally king wisely ones said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
furthermore the ` council ] leaders service has been requested to provide an opinion and the precedency is now waiting for this opinion before continuing discussion
madam president honourable members thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to the liberalisation of the commission as the mean on the most returned project i know that this continues to be a subject to which many of you at that high importance project to which many of you at that high importance
! three ] different approaches to the mandate can be distinguished in this state in the ` council ]
a number of tasks
~ first ] there is a significant number of member states which are clearly in favour of the mandate
efficient in our own support and let me touch a couple of things the commissioner also said about it
this is a combining help and bone hand emergency as the commissioner said and prevention for the future
support for people and also for the future
there can be a combination of those ! two ]
i think the biggest thing is that we are abling things to happen
we need to share inform and for that we need all the platforms where we can easily share the information and also where we can share the beekdata which is very important we are already icc the
they understood
the most incredibly complicated time
so instead of actually blaming and criticising especially personally some people at the ` ecb ] we should appreciate what they did for the way in how our economy has got out of the crisis for jobs they safe ectorally improved a situation in * europe ]
mr president in @ may two thousand and ten ] the ` european parliament ] voted for the single market to be perceived as a holistic unified project finding an equalibrium between an open and sme friendly economy and a solution social and basic rights
however this proud place comes with responsibilities
we need to look further and we need to address the major largely political question as well
they have not got a clobe they do not have a plan they will continue to give ( billions ] of our money to the % eu ] and a completely split out whether to carry out the result of a referendum or not
the ) tunisia ] has a great hand nearly ( eur forty billion ] of % today ] as a ) punishment ] for having a democratic decision to lave
the stories have a too use of commoting position on % brexit ] and showing a blueprint of what an independent britain would look like
the recent commission stepment of states showed that the % uk ] will be handed in over
the citizens shared the would clear the outcline citizens rights and obligations within the single market especially for ) european ] citizens want to move sell shop and work across borders the chair and need for such an initiative was confirmed by the commission 's citizens top printic concerns
the commission must now address these concerns by presenting the top ! twenty ] solutions as soon as possible to restore the crucial variable of credibility amongst its citizens to the market
these measures would correct consumers and assemblies negative perception of the single market thereby boosting their participation in the market and reassuring the citizen that the % eu ] works for them
if you say if you say if he says if he says well perhaps a month or too later i will not accept
the situation in the ` geography ] is indeed terrible and it has been for quite a while and i am deeply concerned about the handling of the current issue with regard to caza province
prepare the elections properly
we should not accept anything unless there is really a broad consensus with all political stakeholders
i would like to see you ms } haymar ] representative despite your comprehensive explanations and the commission to take on an even more prominent role
and of course we took the decision in @ september two thousand and fifteen ] for the & peckage of one hundred and twenty million ] * euros ] and of course it was done to directly support farmers and to see how we can leverage the supply ending month a member state is our economic and public resolution public will say something about it
it is also clear that it should be a joint effort a joint effort by the ` council ] by the ` european parliament ] by the ` european commission ] but also by the producers themselves
the situation in the equical trade markets in many of the member states is very difficult and severe especially in the & way sector ] and the ` council ] is fully aware of the situation and the & wto ] 's difficult problems
the devil will on the agenda for the ` juncker ] to be discussed by the ` council ] member states and the commission
i are still implementing those measures
in market we took ! sixteen ] additional measures together with the ` european commission ] and the ` council ] and those measures relate to intervention measures they relate to promotion measures to export as well as to possibility for member states to give in
but also in the last council it was clear that many member states have stated that if we are going to take again additional measures they have to be linked to the reduction of the bill production
you see an effort increase in the mill production of about @ between five and six ] but it is not a case in every member state so while stating that we need a ) european ] answer at the same time we need flexibility for the member states to implement measures which are suitable for the national circumstances
mr president i would like to thank all the members of ` parliament ] for their remarks but also for their suggestions and certainly the presidency will take them with us to our next discussion in the ` council of june ] who was there we are going to discuss again on @ first ] did it face our situation in their research and i would like to thank all the members of parliament for their remarks
i would like to reiterate what was said by the commissioner } hoken ] that the commission and the ` council ] were not resting under ours
many measures have been taken not only in september but also in markets and of course we see some effects of those measures but are affected of those measures and a situation could have been worse if we did not have taken those dose measures
and yes i would like to reiterate that we need ) european ] approach
it is clear that the ` council ] also stated that we do not want to go back to a croater system and i agree with } oecd ] by mr } hautama ] that we have to improve the situation of the farmer in the supply chain
we have to give them a fair price for depolics
therefore to work on market doss forces told by the commission is so important and in the ` juncker ] still we will have a ~ first ] report of this doss force and hopefully we get some interesting and creative ideas
but at the same time of course we have to support those farmers who have to see how we can help them better than supply and in @ months ] in this
it is not the detriment of the debt government but it is also the detriment of the & wto ] 's debt producers and they are looking into nice markets into improving quality into new market concept
it is also now at this moment discussing possibilities of the reduction of the milk production in the netherlands and of all it is up to the ` council ] in @ june two hours ] the milk production
i believe that we have come up with a good report
because the patronising attitude that we have had in the past has made us look at the ~ second ] or third in line in terms of preference of many recipient states and that effects the notional validity of ` parliament ] ship as well
in one of my amendments and supported by the rapporteur refers to the effect that member states uropol and eurojusts are not granted the possibility to communicate data to non member states and ~ third ] countries because of the absence of sufficient data proper protection and those countries
in my opinion the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control services requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out analyses of the information contained in the system
the review will also increase the effectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of the customs administrations due to the joint outdomated implementation system that will assist in preventing investigating and pursecuting serious controversion allows
sometimes i had the feeling that a little too much of the single time i had the feeling that a little too much of the single orientative energy we in the green group believe that the report is an important one the aim of it is a very legitimate and crucial one for the time
has it been about unleashing the full potential of the & lisbon treaty ] in the field of security and defence we would be in full support
it would be an agency without transparency ` parliamentary ] oversight let alone control we are in full support of centralisation it makes sense in this people but not in this way without any accountability whatsoever
~ secondly ] we believe that before committing large amounts of fresh money to the defence and security we should explore the full potential of efficiency against through cooperation and only after this shall be available through additional funding and might be available through additional funding that might be available through the % european union ] budget or from member states
these are the main reasons why our group is unable to support the report even though we are committed to a stronger ) european ] common defence in security policy and there are many very good ideas in the report in general
an aggressive fiscal planning
they have the potential to enable us to solve many of the ) chritical ] problems confronting us
in order for it to be effective bridging the legitimal devide has to be mainstreamed into every other policy with the coordination systematical development goals
the due to the knowledges have a huge potentialist and terms of reducing poverty increasing the competitiveness of economic and creating employment opportunities
private sector needs to get involved and play rules through its export is and innovation know how
at the same time huge increase in mobil services is securing across the planet and the numbers of mobil users are now surpassing the numbers of people having access to electricity sanction or clean water
in the ` european consensus on development ] which is a crucial document on development policy of the % eu ] and its member states we can find the bold statement that they would continue to support information and communication technologies in developing countries as powerful and abuse of increasive growth and system of development
we are all aware of the fact that also in this area of developing cooperation public funding will not be sufficient for a truly transformative digitalisation process
according to the @ two thousand and sixteen ] warrant development report on the judicial development six billion ] people lack access to high speed internet and ! four billion ] still have no internet access at all
in order to realise these goals both developing countries and develop countries as well as all actors both public and private need to maximise and joint air efforts
special attention has been given to supporting digitalitarian trust and skills to impower people especially women and people in vulnerable environmental situations to promote social inclusion and to facilitate the participation in democratic governance and digitalised economy
whereas the judicisation is rapidly growing globally our partners from developing countries continue to like behind losing the opportunity to fully authorise their human capital towards the achievement of the system at the development goals
at the time when judicisation is growing fast this lack of access is a major challenge to development as it continues to widen governments and inequality single ward
if this potential is to be realised then we must find ways of tarning this technologies into a resource for all people despite the challenges they face within the % eu ] communities what does it mean
for this very reason there is an intent for public private cooperation based on development principles
i very much hope that we can take away the lost exemption for airports and harbours and so on for using these inefficient methods that create people feeling bad
so i think this report is important
and how can you say that you will have a high level of protection when people forget seades on caffairs with ! twenty million ] people 's date on them and when we know that how easier it is to hack into computers sided myself as a kid actually
then you look at the & anti terrorist ] legislation with profiling and you see it creates in security and it creates problems for people to live their daily lives and you cannot combat terrorism with anti terrorism with anti terrorism and create the same insecurity feelings
we can see it 's neither efficient nor legal
the ) german ] surveillance game on @ eighteen two forty years old ] muslim men in % germany ] was not efficient
it counts and it adapt their logic and spends the resources efficiently targeting the specific individual and focus on time on them and instead of going for epidnic registration which is in complete violation with any human rights standards
this matter is extremely important because from * europe ] we can make sure that the latest technology impacts on the usefulness the efficiency of road transport in all its forms
we need more data on the wind screens so that we can sort out our own salvations in a more effective and efficient manner
so often as elected members we journey round our constituences and find ourselves in trafficked gams and so often we have to make forecause to find out what the situation is ahead
i wish mrs } jenson ] and the commissioner every success
madam president i speak as a civil engineer and my son has a transport surveilling business as a speak of a civil engineer and my son has a transport surveilling business for it
it is to the chinese
sell it
this is the key point where we talk about cohesion
this is exactly the moment when a government should step in and some of them do it but some of them do not
it is not makes sense to repeat wrong things it does not make them more true
we are definitely not financing military operations out of our budget in future
it remains with the national budgets and with the national governments and parliaments but we have to become more efficient
this exercise is primarily also and more efficiency exercise because if we plan together if we procure together if we train together that makes us more efficient in the tasks ahead
well in nature we could block everything if we had to lie to rely on nato any vital from any member state would definitely block our access to nato resources
we need a certain amount of strategic and operational autonomy as % eu ] in order to be able to do what we deem appropriate
finally sanctions are part of the efficient % eu ] policies i propose that we should make these more efficient particular in the view of responsible for breaking international laws and human rights prioritions
protection procedures have simplified
i would like to ask the commission and the ` greek ] government to continue the implementation of the approved legislation full implementation on % eu ] law will generate convergence in the quality of reconstitutional framework with the best ) european ] countries
the late payment regulation is a case where the ` creation on economy ] would have big defended to avoid future generation of non performing loans when the next crisis comes
it would also be good to understand how revenues from income tax have been lower into those in @ seventeen ] then in @ two thousand and sixteen ] even though the economy of the country is growing
during the crisis under the strength and during the very limited time new framework including the fiscal compact that we are debating @ today ] voscreated
it is not a good policy
as the consequence country soon after substantial difficulties and people have suffered
the data would observe that in * eurozone ] from @ two thousand and nine ] every year there was decline of the fiscal treaty
~ second ] what is the state of play on the member state competent authorities
mr president the roaming like at home rule was @ one ] of the most significant success tories of the % eu ] @ this year ]
now we have to take it once step further by expanding it to the vestment balk and candidate states already during the accession negotiations
this would be beneficial to the economies to through market integration and better services
these include the textile exploitations of ) syrian ] refugees by those delivering aid on behalf of the % united nations ] and other well known international organisations
several countries including the % united kingdom ] and the % netherlands ] have announced the investigations into the funding they provide to these and other international organisations and that they intend to make measures to prevent similar situations in the future
through its external financial instruments and the ` european development fund ] the % eu ] provides ( billions of euros ] in assistance to ~ third ] countries through international organisations among other channels
i therefore have a few questions for the high representative on a response from the % european union ]
~ first ] of all will the commission on the high representative order a thorough investigation to determine whether % eu ] funds have financed either directly or indirectly the organisations which have been established
~ secondly ] what is the response by the commission and the high representative to the abuse cases that have recently come to light
in order to combat and prevent sexual news conduct and within its national aid organisations is the room for guidelines within the % eu ] 's external financial instruments that would make funding strictly conditional upon respect for principles oversight guidelines accountability and regular reporting from beneficiaries on this issue
~ third ] but not least will the commission and the hiera presentative consider working with member states such as the % united kingdom ] and the % netherlands ] to set up contact points in ~ third ] countries including in crisis or victims victims of abuse
they showed that with a more ambitious proposal the few will saving cost would be much bigger than the cost of a new vehicle relative cost of the increase of a new vehicle
i am prepared to pay more taxes but i have to be fair and they have to be fair and they have to be good taxes
we have control on control sometimes five times
the aim is to perform better to show it simple rules as the commissioner said to combine finance and this is i think the need from beyond
so this is the aim
we made big steps forward and i think we made big steps forward
this is why the complement would depend the commission is investigating as an indicators including demographic change
inclusion in any foreign spite resentment confrontation extremist and sometimes violence in tegration on the associaties a promise of stability and office not only young people can bring to an age in cooperation
the more moral leadership of the ` european parliament ] but also enample by ensuring that giving business is very important for our competitiveness
in order to hear such a global agreement in order to preciate other countries in order to press that at other countries we have to keep pressing our example the example which has its moral importance
this is why it is important to keep in mind that international community will have to share those ghosts
the report is right in saying that without the contribution of developing countries our global efforts will fail
when discussing the future actions aimed at keeping the rising loberal average temperature below to degrees above created levels we cannot ignore the fact that the leader will of countries are not able to cover the coast of necessary investments in cleaner technologies
everybody knows that there are some pressing ) european ] issues like % brexit ] % margu ration ] elections in some member states but we have to take the expectations of our partners in the * vestment balkans ] most seriously otherwise we might lose them
our common vision for the future of the % eu ] has to build on our most charished sector which is our unity
if the room declaration to be on the occasion of the @ sixth year ] the anniversary afford the % european union ] will be about the vision of the multi speed * europe ] then it will become not less than the death strategic of the % european ] project
a vision for the future must not formalise the present day for stations
the ` eight ] rules that were agreed @ seven years ago ] having on micro enterprises taken advantage of the internet to set up small businesses
and ! one ] of you spoke to me sent you a ! tweek ] blaming the member states
so do you think that is the right attitude for the commission to take or is it in conflict with their clear aim to create a digital single market
mr } lauristin ] thank achieve her really want to say that the situation in % turkey ] is reminding me and that other people of my age who have lived in % socialist ] system the days of the beginning of % stalin terror ] but i suppose that now we are able to say that really want to say that the situation in % turkey ] is reminding me and that other people of my age who have lived in social system the days of the beginning of stale and turkey
they are looking at us
of course i do understand the hardships for many ) europeans ] in this crisis
it is necessary to ensure stability and future growth
no politicians should have acted much early in preventing the crisis they failed to react in time
blaming % brussels ] is sadly to say a rather commonway for national politicians and some others to escape their own responsibilities
politics is about responsibility and accountability
you can see improvements now
what i am saying is that the main responsibility what happen in * europe ] is in the capitals of * europe ]
i agree with you that the defence pending is of course awful and the relationship with some of the neighbours
you look at the great challenges of * europe ] its migration and security its solidarity on the lack of solidarity and running inequalities
but having said that our group is also disappointed because we especially hear in ` parliament ] all of us are elected to prepare the future of * europe ] and that means getting into the concerns of * europe ] and you know very well what they are
you do not need all these signaries
it is a social pillar and of course climate change
how do we move forward
every single member every single committee and every single body of this house must be involved
that is what i thank the commission to have presented ! five ] different assent areas even knowing that none of them will be fully accepted
i cannot understand it
we may have forgotten to explain that there is not alternative to the % union ] not in the past not now and not in the future
i agree with personal juncker that the time has come to align espectation with reality
we may have forgotten where we come from
* europe ] belongs to all of us
we come from what death poverty and hanger we come from lack of freedom and we may have forgotten where unity is so important
this debate is necessary at the bate about future that we want for ourselves and for our children
what member states must do is to stop blaming * europe ] for what * europe ] cannot do because it does not have the tools
the ) christian ] is simple how do we want to deal with those challenges
but also do we want to move forward this is a legitimate ) christian ] too because i know that i want to move forward but we cannot just blame those who do not want to go further than we are now by calling them anti ) europeans ] we all are ) europeans ] and we all are ) europeans ]
they have to be confronted with their own responsibilities and i think that deserve very important steps to bring transparency and democracy and eligibility to this process of reforming the % european union ] in the next future finally i would like to say
that the ` epp group ] bears a proof its own strategy
we are reshaping a multi micro credit framework can help us reinforce and rebuild our economies from the community upwards
i think the economic crisis has forced us to take a longer hard look at our past and economic behaviour
i sincerely hope that following on from this excellent report we see significant and qualificant and qualificated action at community level to support the invaluable work that has done and by and for my grow enterprise at local and national level around the % european union ] as it is a very important part of our economy into the future
addressing an approving access to micro credit offers us the opportunity to address these past mistakes
that in turn i think offers us an opportunity to learn from our past mistakes
onward going to the future i can see that city continue to expand on the basis of these well allegated well controlled funds i would call for more involvement of the private sector in the way that the funds are allegated and managed and controlled because i think the private sector can always do a more efficient job than the public sector
i would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these moneys have been to the roral areas of the north west west where there is a lot of agricultural areas which are vital to the whole economy
this is a very interesting development and essential at this time in the economic situation
it must also be used to bring in private finance ~ thirdly ] because a different approach is from different member states we would like to have a look whether it feezible to have an % eu ] framework for norm bank micro finance institutions
we have to ensure that our legislation is proportionate to the problems we are dealing with and particularly the ` epp ] see that we have talked about @ today ]
it could by itself be the biggest helpful businesses in the % european union ]
a head of voting on the legislation of the food we should recall the reasons for having been prudent and the ware of risks for health and wealth for of animals
we know from our past experience with the similar issues that tackle both food safety and ethical relations between humans as dominant species and nature that public perception depends very much on the specific knowledge of the matter
consumers are increasingly sensitive about suffering and injuring of farm animals and therefore they have right to be informed about the potential of cloaning to cause pain and to waste natural resources
yet the due level development of animal cloaning as a matter of food production is being pursued without public awareness
the problem which cloaning does not concern just well for our fanimals but also consumer confidence in food since it is believed that in * europe ] food is produced to a very high standard
the euro barrometer study from % last october ] documented serious public concerns in regard to capital use of food products from clones this is linked to the sale of important food which could be eventually sold in * europe ] without being labelled as product from clone to animals
i therefore agree with rapporteurs approach urge the commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clothes
among other problems which have been covered by the amendments dabled by my political group i wish particularly support the sharing of information from animal testing so to avoid the need for new tests involving animals
it is also visible understandable not only among ourselves but also more and more outside
this all creates a nightmare for the budget negotiations
it is ongoing intended to cut as much as possible without any rational and at the same time taking new obligations new commitments
we have a unique situation to solve the problem with no expenses for demembers
so the note the reply from the ` council ] is whether the ` council ] and the members data prefer to take this money to their own pockets and to ignore the commitments they have made in the past and to ensure the payments they have to make or they want to really address the problem show they will really address the problem show their % european ] review and pay the build
the decision on all the whole set of her amending budgets could be made very easily
@ spend days ] and days trying to figure up whether the ` council ] is going to respect its commitments or not
we create additional tangents in the budget of @ two thousand and fifty ]
we have to give it back to the member states
it is clear that we will continue to have great partners within the % united states ] even if they further are government decided to stay on the side of the road
finally my last remark to this house is that the war 's reaction to pressing and transaction prove that the % european union ] is on the right side of % christony ]
united
as we heard a lot of her political leaders in * europe ] say that we would keep up the engagements in the & paris agreement ]
it is our goal
we have to add no what we have been partially reopen
mr president it is positive that the % eu ] delegation in % geneva ] will give a strong priority to defend the universality of human rights against efforts from several countries to undermine this concept
more than ever it is crucial that the % eu ] 's support for human rights ` council ] financially and politically to ensure that it can continue to work independently
however i deeply regret that the ` council ] did not include a reference to the ` un ] binding treaty on business and human rights which is the single most important normative process currently ongoing however i deeply regret that the ` council ] did not include a reference to the ` un ] binding treaty on business and human rights which is the single most important normative process currently ongoing
the % eu ] has not been constructive in the process and hope that the % eu ] will listen to the request by the ` european parliament ] and give its full and unconditional support to the ` un ] binding treaty process
mr president the ` multis prime minister ] has predicted that the number of people crossing to * europe ] will reach record level
most of these people will come from % libya ] into % italy ] via people traffickers as we know
the best way to stop these huge numbers of people illegally coming into * europe ] and to stop the large numbers of tragic deaths in the * mediterranean ] is surely to turn the boats back and process the migrants off shore
that is why ! six ] ) european ] countries now have been in private talks with % australia ] asking them which way to work things out because they know that the % eu ] way is failing
only @ today ] we have been warned by the ) italian ] officials that % gaddis ] are actually plugging the gaps in funding for their actual campaign by smuggling people into * europe ] because their oil money is running out
it is good forward
we have been taking their count most if not all of concerns what have been raised by analysing the previous trade deals with other countries and i think that we can vis great confidence say that this trade deal is in many ways a golden standard for future trade deals in the world
it is not meant to do this and this is why i would like to say to those who are not listening to the fact that following the alternative news and not trying to go into the depth of the analysis of this trade deal please do not bark at the wrong tree
thank you to candidate for this
it will deliver trade in goods and decrease terrorists
! first ] of all do we want to defend our freedoms and our liberties
setting is like like a life house for these guidelines for many who are searching for avelse and trade
so from that perspective i would say that every country just like my small country } latvia ] will benefit out of this
the ~ first ] direction is protectionism provision alism decline and building of waters
we take the direction of protectionism and closeness or we will fight for liberal democratic values for growth and for the new golden standards of international trade
it is a unique chance for the % european union ] now to take again a leading position in the global economy and global politics and in many ways devote for * setta ] will decide about this never before world needed such a strong * europe ] at this moment and it needs a guidelines for good trade
do we really want it
of course set a trade deal is not a cure a medicine for each and every decease
world is about ging the % european union ] which direction will take
we have been dying in the ~ second ] vote war for our freedoms and liberties and also now when the % european union ] are facing security challenges its external borders canadians soldiers again our on our sandi beaches in * northern europe ]
jographic indications a lot of jographic indications for many other producers and of course they invest in part
the ~ second ] direction is the openness to the world it is a leadership it is an effective decision making it is a growth and finally also a bringing of wealth to our % union ] and each in every nation and member state here in the % european continent ]
it will deliver additional possibilities for services
@ two thousand and fourteen ] @ judgment ] because since @ two thousand and sixteen ] we have been discussing in the ` european parliament ] more than ! eighteen ] times in different large groups what this trade deal really means for us
try to find other solutions for other existing problems but go forward with % zisdia ]
it is not switch out this light vote for setting
it is comprehensive but it will not solve all the problems that our workers small and medium enterprises and people are facing
the good single
because most of us believe the site is good for our economy particularly for smes and it does not threaten our choices values or laws
the ` sd group ] has tabled its own consential resolution which clarifies what we mean by progressive trade agreements by spelling out clearly what we do not like about cita and inspect to be further corrected in & syta ] where agreed or in future trade agreements more widely better provisions on sustainable development and assanctions based approach
@ two thousand and february ]
the sm
improved transparency for all trade agreements in future
but it is also an act of trust and an offer of pattership towards the % eu ] institutions not to be the commission and the ` council ] with which we want to work together for a better trade policy and towards canada which is a country that shares our values our objectives and our hopes for a better future
we welcome as a group of defact that many of the citizens concerns have been addressed through the clarifications and commitments from the commission and the economic and authorities through the joint detailed applicative instruments and the other instruments in the package sitting is not perfect far from it but it is an important step in the right direction a more progressive trade policy where the benefits are really spread among all citizens
! twenty four million ] ) europeans ] are unemployed ! twelve million ] ) europeans ] are long term unemployed and ( eur five million ] on employed ) europeans ] are under the aids of
we the representatives of the people of * europe ] need to rethink labour market policies
if we want * europe ] and ) europeans ] to prosper in the @ twenty first century ] we must create a competitive ) european ] labour market and part of this is exactly to avoid the midsmeat
too many and too strong protectionist measures have blocked initiative flexibility opportunities
this mismet is unfortunate for many ) europeans ] whom are out of work
it is unfortunate for our societies which miss out wealth and prosperity
we need to promote flexibility
it is unfortunate for the businesses which cannot fill their vacances
in too many places in * europe ] the labour market is riched even static
this miss mess on the ) european ] labour market causes an uncompetitive ) european ] labour market
explosives and points
the fact is other than a small reduction over our fuel usage there is no environmental
in recent wages we have seen a lot of propaganda outlining the support of environmental trade insults of electoral post fishing but the fact is little independent non part of gender science has been completed
we all want it more in % real ] but it is not true that nothing has been achieved
like mr } hopping state ] this will be my last speech before this chamber after @ twenty years ]
the other dam is quite clear that some key % eu ] policies will be undermined without proper financing and therefore we are happy to support the proposal
~ secondly ] we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies because if they did they would be subject of course to the intrinstitutional agreement on agencies
the budget committee recognises the importance of these proposals and the urgency
finally we would not want the budget to commit his position to being anyway undermined by the ) russia ] for these proposals
with the respect of the equal pay for the same job
this house is still deliberating on the approach to be taken for the revision of this directive
mr president i agree with mrs } jata ] to tell each other that we discussed this issue in the plenary session and i thank you all colleagues and all members who brought this question it is extremely important for the consumers and for the well functioning digital single market to have a new transport services
transparency and neutrality of the search of flights increased competition and made trouble within the % eu ] affordable for many ) europeans ]
we will continue discussion on this subject in our working group on the & givelsingle market ] which i chair and precisely during our @ next meeting ] it will be on @ two thousand and second ] of november and you are all invited to join us but let us not forget that this is not the only problem that consumers encounter when booking the flights
they are often geographical and have to pay a higher price because of their place of residence or to put it more precisely because of the temporary location where based on their ) european ] dress
the consumers cannot be discriminated online and they are charged of best offers cannot be restricted by business models
reminded us of this possibility
i think we should do more to protect local communities as well as the indeed search species in the park such as the mounting of relevance and opposite
@ yesterday ] the committee received a high representative right and vice president of the commission mrs } mogarine ] whose dress again the link between development and security i would also like to stress here in this debate on the protection of the bureaucratic national park the link between development equality and security
we call on the commission and the member states to further address the root causes of anti conflicts and corruption and to support sustainable development and peace building strategies in the park and in the surrounding region and we also urge the commission to member states that we are seeing are seeing the member states we call on the commission and the member states to further address the rule causes of anti conflicts and corruption
i recall that all exploration and exploitation are not compatible with united all world carriers to state

even and that is particularly interesting when there is no essential authority in play
it would use it for diligent rights management for music films or electronic football techniques
let me briefly explain to you what this is about
as a lot of potential some people even like in it to the kind of revolution that was sparked by the introduction of the internet and have to say although not all fellow } shadow rapporteurs ] are here we have to say although not all fellow shadow rapporteurs are here we had very exciting very interesting very interesting and frankly very interesting very interesting very interesting and frankly very interesting very interesting very interesting and frankly very interesting very interesting very interesting and interesting very interesting very interesting and frankly very interesting very interesting very interesting very interesting very siting very interesting very solue
its virtual currences and distributed legislative technology so one would be forgiven by thinking where this is a dole and some miferal subject that perhaps will gently put us into sleep at this hour of the day
what we advocate in the report is not to stiff linvation by regulating now but instead it is closely monitor what is going on by the creation of a task force which we suggestion be created at the level of the commission and then to regulate
some of you may have wondered why is it so much sheeper to send an % email ] or as a mess then to transfer funds for example from somebody working in ! one ] country and sending remittences back home because in the end this transfer fund is not much more than an electrossed funding message even today but still it can be rather expensive seven per cent eight of the funds transferred
in interesting area for government applications fighting a very tea fraud or using it and implementing it in a novative land and a land register of course with such a new technology its early days
of course this technology could help us to reduce these transactions costs significantly in the long rone and i think if we regulate well we might even have an open access electronic wallets where the transfer of funds would be decided by some sort of leaders cost rounding
we are not at the stage where and the risk that come with any such technology our systemic
but of course ! one ] would be wrong because this new technology has a lot of promise
fundamentally what this is about this distribute of legitimal technology that underlies the bit coin and the most prominent virtual currency is a decentralised data base that keeps a record of any sort of transaction done within that data base in a way that is surprisingly safe resilient and trustworthy
this technology can be used indeed as the title of the national report would suggest for virtual currencies and in order to reduce the cost of financial transaction significantly
it would use it for clearing a settlement and automatic contracts for example implementing the relatives on the distributed ledger far beyond the financial sector
i have lodged my papers with the court of first instance so i intend to fight a very robust case
all i would like to say is that the big fossil bother about my ` parliamentary ] assistance expenses and covered by the media over @ the last nine or twelve months ] it has been harrowing experience
i understand i have a very good case and also along with that i have gone for intrim measures which means that no money will be pable until the court has heard all the evidence and made the appropriate decision
i only heard the last ! ten ] words
at the same time concluding to the objectives of the simple collective we have also succeeded in future proof in the legislation by introducing provisions on sovereign data and explicitly banning the use of the field devices finally the labour will be able to strengthen for measures to accept the good ability or repability thereby further helping consumers to save money and at the same time consumers to save money and at the same time consumers to save money and at the same time consumers to save money and at the same time consumers to save money and at the same time concluding to the objectives of the simple corruption
the close examination
focussion on energy efficiency efforts will reduce for buildings products or industry it is more important than ever in order to ensure the security of supply and a successful energy transition while promoting investment growth and jobs
@ two thousand and eight hundred ] people and their families are now facing serious difficulties and they are left reloated any income and even any hope
the minimum way is in itself is not the problem
some people are claiming that the ) german ] application of the * minimum ] wages is one of the most serious attacks on the single market since the adoption of the single market act these protectionist missils create barriers all the way down in * europe ]
this is very serious and very worrying
coming from a country where the social partners are actually doing the collective bargaining i am not against a minimum weight but it is up to the partners to decide what should be the level and i would from a country
it was initially expected that imas registered companies would have preformed better since the ` imas ] invital requirements are tougher as compared with oda and better known certificates such as ` iso ]
among them is align in the definition of imas which i saw particularly important
now the problem is how modern technologies can be used for investmental protection and how industry all services should be helped in promoting the environmental value of the production
existing voluntary and regulatory instruments were not linked to each other in order to establish synergies
mr president the ` european ] legislation was set to encourage enterprises to improve their products and attain higher standards of energy efficiency and invergence
from path experience we know that certificates on various levels were not sufficiently coordinated
equal labelling as a part of huge action plan on sustainable production consumption and industrial policy is such a tool
the ~ first ] revision of the * amaz kim ] was not encouraging
the good of ecological certificates is to engage synergies with other legal acts that are tackling in the mandamental effects of the products
it is about striking the balance between regulatory and market based instruments with the aim of developing voluntary standards for various products and services or helping to updomase production processes and making more effective use of resources
it would help organisation to proceed more easily from % iso ] to imastandards
@ fourteen thousand and one ] yet imas registered companies were not performing better and the system of environmental excellence was weaker as compared with the ` isola ]
in partial system of certification will be we suppose appreciated also by consumers i hope that this will help organisation to choose the most rational systemic approach in order to interconnect different fields of investment protection
the people 's are but republic of % china ] is a global power with all its means of a centralised powerful state
what i see today when i look at hong cong is a big powerful draging trying to silence those who actually have the same dream as i had once when i started in politics @ twenty years ago ]
by imposing a squeezing mechanism the chinaism the chinaese government will disqualify candidates for the @ two thousand and seventeen ] chief executive election that do not meet the government 's approval
i am one of those who engage in politics in a real young age at @ sixteen years ] old
if we do not speak up when fundamental democratic principles are also sending another type of message we tell those students that democracy is important for us and we are lucky that we can benefit from meeting the % european union ] but we do not really carry for them benefit from eating some of the % european union ] but we do not speak up when fundamental democratic principles are also sending another type of message we
mr } speaker ] there are many reports from various sources coming in on the current situation in % hong kong ] but there is clear that the authorities are trying to many political lates and limits in some cases even violently the democratic process
when students peacefully protest for their democratic and indeed human rights anywhere in the world they disterved to be backed up by ossiering the % european union ] as a global power of democracy
if we in this house are silenced we approve of the message from the government of % china ] and that is why we have to protest and make sure that demonstrators actually are seen and that we do not forget their deeds
~ second ] i do not believe on ministers group but i believe that the % eu ] in the presence of the high representative has capacity to broke the negotiations
it is going to give the impression that is in the driving seat the sole of the problem
so we have a ) european ] economic recovery plan of which the ` european industry ] is a part
it is reality each manufacturers go not to look at itself as best it can and each country will look after its manufacturers as best it can
there is of course a possible case for some support for some financial support to the current industry and other sectors to keep capital in tackle in tackle in tackle and to keep skills intact
but this can only be decided to the national level because the support from the ` european investment bank ] mentioned by } mrbarroso ] that support can only be provided by national taxpayers but there is one thing that the % european union ] can constructively do here at least until the recession is over and that is given
he has come manufacturers a break from environmental restrictions
the interest is already in serious trouble
these environmental other standard restrictions make cars more expensive
it is already a killof and industry which is already a serious both industry which is already a serious both
in order to address concerns expressed by ` parliament ] the extension of the economies trade preferences is subject to a craine 's respect for the essential elements of the association agreement
the unilateral market access goanted to equaline corresponds to the ~ first ] hear of application of the scatchel of consensus negotiated under the & ecr fta ]
economic political security and territorial challenges i would like to thank ` parliament ] 's mrs } juncker ] for the efforts already made to pave the way for a swift conclusion of the legislative procedure for this fune in order to ensure that trade flows are not disrupted
in addition safeguard controls are in place to prevent market distorting surges impacting adversity on ) european ] companies and industry including the agriculture sector
a spart of the september two thousand and elcome the commission also agreed to submit a proposal to extend until the @ end of two thousand and fifteen ] the autonomous trade preferences commonly granted to % icraine ] as they will otherwise seek to apply as of
expressed satisfaction when the association agreement was ratified
the proposal by the commission for such delay was based on a clear request for mechanism to take an initiative which would allow a radification of the association agreements to go ahead while leaving more time to discuss ways of addressing from the implementation of the & g twenty ] implementation of the & g twenty ] in the & d tw ]
this outcome must be seen in the bigger political context
the common proposal simply extends the duration of those autonomous preferences by ! fifteen ] additional months thus maintaining the same preferences
most importantly from an economic point of view the ) iranian ] 's trade preferences have very limited empt on the % eu ] markets and yet at the same time they will present a gesture of tangible economic and political support to a craine in a difficult situation helping to address a craine 's difficult
the % eu ] feature sanctary rules remain fully applicable to % european ] products
let me recall the basic elements of these autonomous trade preferences
we must stand shoulder shoulder with the crime in face of the extremely difficult political and territorial challenges it faces but also in its process of reforms and economic more organisation
delays in the extension of trade preferences should indeed be avoided and this could have an impact on economic operators decision to import goods for mucraine
even ritoractive application risks not fully repairing interferences with trade flows and would be companies not only for the economic operators but also our competent national customs authorities
it is certainly not neutral when it comes to women
the ) bottomline ] has been said here over and over there has to be some stepping up over the work there has to be some binding measures
i hope and expect the commission to take this on board because it also means a lot in who we are as a player on the global level
as it is going to take gender quality further and social rights in the % eu ] traders if we do not do it
we decide what is monitored and when and how and if
without the power to measure analyse utilised fishing data the % uk ] will still be unable to formulate its own fisheries policies and will remain under the hedge mandate of the search pay
this report is the trollion house the cooker in @ the next the fifth ] column the hidden enemy within
significantly this under the & socalled great repeal bill ] which is no such thing and the % uk ] has lost half the bouts of reclaim our own fisheries and waters before the negotiation has even begun
we have the opportunity to commissioner to take up and full responsibility and ambition and take the side of ` parliament ]
our high level of ambition on renewable states fully into account a recent spectacle of constraduction in % southern penalts ] and of % shorwin ]
my understanding way is that during the @ martin securing the last couple of firms ] there was an important shift of peridime in the whole migration and refugee issue a shift from just allowing ( millions ] and millions of migrants coming to * europe ]
towards treating the rule of course is and treating the whole issue locally
is the policy of the % european union ] following at the & martin seven ] presidency this kind of peridency shift is what my country hongery has been fighting for a long time and we shall never give up
the benefits of globalisation do indeed have to reach all citizens and all communities
i strongly believe that the % eu ] can make a difference in the essential fields of labour rights and in the long term protection amongst others and also through its distince chapters in our ftas
in conclusion to all that work i can show the ` ppe ] groups view that we see sanctions as a last resort mechanism and would appliciate turning towards more effective ways to deal with the problem at hand
the experience gathered so far at the global level shows that trade related sanctions fall short of delivering the desired results
we do not seek conclusive evidence that sanctions could lead to an improvement of the effectiveness and implementation of the chapters
the way forward is to consolidate these chapters and to strive for the more effective and sustainable implementation of this important pillar in our value based trade policy
} ted ] being set to address any doubts that may arise during @ this debate ] efsf is not an unconditional support
i believe that our common goal is to help % ukraine ] but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation
at long term loans the assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in % ukraine ] which is done by ukraining with the % ukrainian ] authorities a memorandum of understanding
this means that rapporteur does not support any amendment stable to the plenary and to recommend close the file in the ~ first ] reading to end i would like to underline once again disreport is just a legal basis what the ` european commission ] to disperse the money
~ third ] to reform process which has been important but is not really steadied and till now
therefore it is crucial that a ! two ] unfound failed anti corruption measures will be part of the new conditions
a step into the right direction is the adoption of the law on high and the corruption court is last week
in that context i would like to identify the ` element ]
if corruption is not addressed dressed dressed dressed dressed dressed dressed dressed and my fair fund should not be delivered to % ukraine ]
in addition to newly adopted clause was signed @ yesterday ] by the president of % ukraine ] i welcome the rapporteur } welcomes ] this news with great satisfaction it means that % ukrainian ] state to commit men seriously
~ first ] to personally conflict and casualities in the east of % ukraine ] and to halt every socioeconomic consequences of this aggression ~ second ] to the economic recovery which remains flexible
hence to need for support to these reforms into contexts where many interests can play against especially in a pre election years
but they will do so only when ) ukrainians ] manage to fill fill on the % ukraine ] and outstanding conditions
they are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve to economic civilisation and to support the reforms no it is very important to remind that the commission can stand to last transfer to last transparent and emf air programme when some new crimes commitments were not fulfilled
in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation this is a first time that the commission proposals and mff ii for the % ukraine ] since the beginning of tomorrow in @ two thousand and fourteen ] this time the commission proposes ! one billion ]
if we are serious about our goal we cannot slow down to procedures
this memorandum sets out the supporting policy measures which are conditional for the dispursements of the fund
i am very grateful that we are where we are now indeed % ukraine ] needs this report and it deserves this report and i think it is very appropriate to have this next programme now
it is not included in the joint declaration you explicitly refer to that because that it is what it is also about
we need to be very clear in this regard
however the internal ecosol is to remain that of the implementation
we recommend taking advantage of % lisbonia ] presidency in the ` ecr partnership ] summit in the long term diligence as an opportunity to improve relations with % zbalaris ] of course as soon as all political prisoners have been released and to restart the political dialogue on inter alia democratic reforms free and fair elections and respect for human rights
however for vote is probably @ that third ] time we discussed % belgars ] and its relations with the % eu ] not by reacting to their frequent negative news from this country but rather by trying to analyse the situation and thus propose concrete policy actions i would like to thank the two thousand and first time we discuss belgars and its relations with the % eu ] not by reacting to their frequent negative negative news from this country but rather by trying to actually action and thus
therefore we urge % bulgaria ] to lift any obstacles and restrictions to exercise the freedoms of association expression movement peaceful assembly thoughts for democratic opposition and gm jos
it is very important instrument and should be used for strengthening people 's understanding for need for reforms and for the development also an appropriate social net
i believe that all these and other artificial barriers should be broken down as soon as possible
we recommend encouraging the rebider civil society including trade unions and business representatives as well as the political opposition alongside with officials to increase their envolvement in their dialogue on modernisation
some influential ) european ] politicians belief that % bulgaria ] is lost for their % eu ]
it would be done in area very thoughtful way in order to improve their effectivenesses and adopt their scope nature and validity reacting to their developments in their country
the real need to build a democracy in the % european union ] to have a top down elected selective and cooperated by ) european ] parties or what is really very balanced put for ) european ] movements of national parties

they must take ~ second ] place to splace ! second ] friddle to the needs of our port and our board
it is obvious for everyone that the current system is unfair and has a devastating effect on honest experience including small and medium sized enterprises therefore i cannot see any reason why not to act in order to change this situation

you need to show companies that they cannot be rewarded for losing them because in @ the last two years ] we will actually tank behaviour has caused more than machines to complain in companies
when it comes to % remedies ] may i suggest that all companies sit down with deterritorical experts together with the commission to try to find non discriminating future proven remedies thank you very much
let me remind you that time helps monopolies and damages smes
mr president a dear colleague dear high representative i am looking on these issues especially as a spoke 's person for security and defence from the ` epp ] and in this specific policy area it is so obvious that the % us ] is and will remain an indispensable partner

@ grassia ] 's interpretation of % committee on turn ] spirits and the countability especially in the use of public fund
a party represented by ! one ] mep still needs to be represented in at least a quality of the member states in order to be resistent
let me sure we make it more open and inclusive less formal and regions
this is very good news and an important element of the study success is to ensure everybody is from board
this is why we propose and hands in the coordination at all levels through the establishment of an % european union ] youth coordinator in the design of national action plans
citizens cannot go on being disolutioned one summit after another
services and profissional qualifications directives consumer address and smes incentives
lack of proper transposition and information potential of the digital market
otherwise for the citizen unless there is this realisation this will become nothing more than a meaningless tired buzz word
this resolution is a call for economic growth but in my opinion it is also an indication of differentiation which ` parliament ] and perhaps also decommission is experiencing the zovereign effective completion of the single market
we are already feeling unfortunately the effects of protectionism in various ways
however and most importantly it must be a market which is credible and well understood and trusted by citizens providing ) europeans ] with a realistic and holistic action growth planned in order to achieve a truly competitive inclusive and social economy
time is running short and the continued unity and integration of the market are being seriously threatened
the relocation of the economy and the single market will need the continued importance and import and hopefully the leadership of the commission and the commitment on earship by the member states
once again we are discussing the potential of the single market but the citizen is targeted of disretoric and instead once to see the realisation of this potential because the single market is very vital for a % european union ]
it would be deeply said if the @ fifth year ] of this legislature were to find our service finding out yet another resolution on the single market and debating the same problems that were identified in @ the first year ] amongst others differentiation and inadequate application of rules
at this high time the ` council ] came up with more coordinated urge and specific solutions and decisions to decrise its created after all by the responsible behaviour of some banks this ` parliament ] and the commission have been making specific proposal and initiatives yet we seem to move very slowly
we had an ambitious and thoughtful ` parliament ]
and for the first time we had an ambitious proposal by their commission
the late payment regulation is a case where the ` criticonomy ] would have dictivensed to avoid future generation of non performing loans when the next crisis come
i would like to ask the commission and the ` greek ] government to continue the implementation of the approved legislation full implementation on % eu ] law will generate convergence in the quality of reconstitutional framework with the best ) european ] countries
it would also be good to understand how revenues from income tax have been lower in @ two thousand and seventeen ] the @ enthusian and sixteen ] even though the economy of the country is growing
the future of pollen in * europe ] is state capture by a single party that is not the future
i support this holidarity movement in the ages that the ) polish ] community movement in the attacks that the polish community denounced as skinger zawood as % rottenwest ] today when i am ready to translate a translation of programmes of the ) europe ] public chieving and radio i am getting the apprair impression that we are already close to skinger zawood again when we insist that the rule of law and the separation of powers respect of your own constitution is demanded
i wonder can you explain to me how a simple law can overrule an explicit provision in the constitution with regard to the direction of the mendit of a judge in the supreme court
you were said we should listen to citizens and their concerns
@ today ] you talk to us about a martial plan for * africa ] while poland is a country which does have no development ministering no development agency and investing
the aim is to perform better to show it simple rules as the commission has said to combine finance and this is i think the need from beyond
we had control on control sometimes five times
we made big steps forward and think we made big steps forward
so this is the aim
they have not got a clobe they do not have a plan they will continue to give ( billions ] of our money to the % eu ] and a completely split out whether to carry out the result of a referendum or not

mr president we all know that % nigeria ] is a huge country the most populated in * africa ] and we all know that it is devastated by injustice and violence not only of religious grounds but also on sociological economic and political grounds
that is why it happens that % nigeria ] is one of the fire priority countries of the * migration partnership ] and in depth contexts i myself have been a member of a delegation to % nigeria ] a number of times with some other colleagues here
migration illicit migration roots is the origin of massive and gross human rights violation aiming mostly on women and defenceless children
this resolution tackles the call on the fight on ` boko haram ] and its terrorism but also addresses the ) nigerian ] authorities to reform security forces to make sure that they prevent extraordinary detentions and torture and to reform the criminal judicial system to make sure that the law is enforced to fight the criminal judicial system to make sure that the law is enforced to fight the criminal and extraordinary union
* europe ] has probably never needed solidarity and equality more than @ today ]

we are still optimistic about this very complicated programme and on behalf of the ` epp ] group i can say that i fully support this tend
the internal situation remains extremely complicated but we must understand that it is our shared pollen and shared responsibility
the measure problem remains national reconsideration which means serious efforts to develop inclusiveness and mutual trust

it is a tragedy that this can go on year after @ year ] without anything has happened

if the government has the will power to control our own borders not pay a membership fee not to have to comply with % eu ] regulations and directives

the fifth largest economy in the world
we have links all over the gold to the anglish fear that commonwealth the emerging markets of the far east
i am however glad that the prime minister made it clear that we are leaving the single market
i would also like to interest in that the conclusions of the ` council ] at meeting raised issues of migration and security because these ! two ] issues go hands in hand as has recently been shown by the attacks on our continent
i am also concerned that there was no mention of immediate emigration controls which means that by the time we are fully out of the % eu ] on contrends we could have another ( million ] people coming to our country from the continent
on our dolings
it is outrised by a ) un ] 's security ` council ] resolution it complements the efforts of the * african union ] force

madam president a dear colleague dear high representative i am looking on these issues especially as a spoke 's person for security and defence from the ` epp ] group and in this specific policy area it is so obvious that the % us ] is and will remain an indispensable partner

in the members of the socialist and democratic family in this house we do truly care about the rule of law and separation of power and independence of the judiciary and of course we understand legitimate concerns every time there is a risk abreach of the rule of law regarding a judicial reform in a member state

the commission should analyse all possibilities in order to ensure that also operational programmes resubmitted after the deadline of @ two thousand and fourteen ] are taken into consideration in order to conclude the inter service consolidation by @ the end of the year ] and we treat as ready for adoption if they fulfil the quality requirements
what can be done to ensure that the revision process goes smoothly and is finalised before @ first ] of may @ two thousand and fifteen ] especified in & article nineteen of multiannual financial framework regulation ] so as to avoid losing uncommitted amounts from to
but the programming stage is still far from being finalised
what is the commission 's current position regarding the treatment of commitment of commitments for operational programmes covered cofinanced by the european regional development fund the european social fund the ) european ] agricultural fund for the rural development the & european maritime ] and future respond and the cohesion fund which will not be adopted by the end of
moreover for programmes not railly for adoption by @ thirty first december two thousand and fourteen ] the @ two thousand and fourteen ] commitments can only be preserved by rebuilding a month from the @ two thousand and fourteen ] in accordance with & article nineteen of the multiannual financial framework regulation ]
as a direct consequence there will be significant delay in the concrete start up of the project implementation
only a limited number of operational programmes have been adopted and according to the latest information available only a little bit more than ( one hundred ] programmes will be actually adopted by @ the end of this year ]
however these teamplies are revision of the multiannual financial framework on the basis of a commission proposal with the ` council ] 's agreement of ` end parliament ] 's concern
what were the main problems encountered and by which member states
however @ two thousand and fourteen ] should not be a lost year as regards investment from the ( european ] structural and investment funds in this context i would like to table the following question
@ two thousand and fourteen ] in this connection there is the commission in visitating any measures to facilitate the implementation of the operational programme
rainforced the legal framework for the protection of the % union ] 's financial interest achieving the significant results
it distorts the competition sometimes it helps to finance regal activities and efforts it are too high it can push up the text rates in other categories
i am grated that important part of the proposal is simplificated in the tax compliance especially for small and medium sized businesses
i believe that better collection of taxes should not be used for increasing over the government revenues
in my view money gained should be invested mainly in the reduction of the public debt and the reduction of the most devastating taxes for the economic growth
i am not going to go through all the details in which we are able to support many other months of the ! three ] different ) narians ] worked out in the package
if we should do the planning for forestructure and it would be better if those who do this planning would be answerable to some body possibly a parliamentary body at the same time
stand up settlements are cardinated and expert
we sings as a concept of public good for the ` if air ] should be clarified as well as the potential conflict between the private nature of the ` isi ] being the standard settler and the public good nature of the ` if airs ] applied to the in more than ! one hundred and ten ] countries and jurisdictions
let me focus on the main points of this report
in @ january two thousand and seventeen ] the commission has proposed a instrument that we are discussing @ today ] a macro financial assistant package covering approximately ! twenty five ] of the centre only a quater of the country 's financial needs is identified by the ` imf ]
if done properly it is my strong belief these reforms have a high potential systemic impact
to conclude in its current form the decision gives us the green light if we vote positively @ tomorrow ] for the age of % mordova ]
even stronger conditionalities attached to the disbursement of each of the ! three ] installments
! sixty million ] would be alone and ( eur forty million ] would be agrant to be disbursed in ! three ] installments in @ two thousand and seventeen ] ideally and in
the other ! two ] institutions have accepted ! one hundred ] of our requests the agreement registering the trilogue also includes a joint statement by the ` european parliament ] the ` council ] and the commission recalling that the necessary pre condition for the dispressment of the assistance is the respect of effective democratic institutions
the ambitious programme of reforms will cover financial sector governance public sector governance fight against corruption fight against money laundering energy sector reforms improvements of their business and investment climate
i have come up with this proposal to adopt this joint statement in order to address concerns of callings in this industry in the house regarding the recent initiative by the authorities to change the electoral system in the republic of % modova ]
the principle is no reforms no money
i am strong emphasis on the fact that the consideration by the } modovan authorities ] of the ` recommendations of the ` venezuelan commission ] will be part of the regular monitoring of the respect of the & affordantian pre condition ]
however it does not mean immediate dispersement
we have clarified that conditions are not being to be attached to the disbursement of each and every of the ! three ] installments that benchmarks should be clear as required by the ) european ] controvolvers and that the assistance should be immediately suspended or terminated if the conditions are not met
this in order to address the shorter balance of payments and fiscal bulgariabilities of the * modovan ] economy the proposed assistance therefore amounts to ( one hundred million ]
these are informed that we discipline and constrain the exercise of power by the government and any other economic oppolitical actor for generations to come
i would like ~ first ] of all to thank the commission for the very clear stance on the joint statement adopted by the ! three ] institutions and the intention stated here publicly beyond doubt to properly enforce it
it is not there right thing to do it
i would also encourage the ) modovan ] authorities to truly reach out to the opposition and to child society and engage in this discussion on the if the discussion continues on the model transformation of the electoral system but i also encourage the other parties to accept the invitation for dialogue
a deproper democracy requires loyal democrats on all sides and
if we look at the current situation for customers no real safeguards exist against flight cancellations or delays
how do passengers really feel when they do ) garian ] air flight but they do not know whether it will ever take off and then the company playing poor planning of staff holidays it is not only the customers who work on our leaders and do not get back when flights get cancelled
what are the workers social conditions if they are only being paid for the hours you are flying with no income security when flights are cancelled
it is the model of aviation we want in * europe ] or elsewhere a new model of legal slavery
i saw him on televation
! one ] may weakness however in the commission proposal and that is that there was no provision for the setting off of tires that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date i believe that is a major flaw
her car was destroyed but she worked away relatively unheart why because the car she was driving had the most modern safety features and that enabled her not to be seriously injured
however in the current circumstances the ` council ] given that cars are not being sold it was quite clear in the discussions we had with the ` council ] that in @ fact ] these twelve months was probably unrealistic and we have to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tires
as mr } harbour ] and the commission 's point out simplification is part of this proposal and finally i would draw attention to what we have done in terms of an emphasis in road services in reducing noise
that is the context in which we are discussing this report
that is why i proposed to the committee and the committee accepted and amendments that said these tyres did not meet these standards after the implementation date should be sold off after @ twelve months ]
i will bring to the attention to this house that none of those free are a woman
i think it is very strange that a commission cannot come up with ! one ] single woman that is confident for ! one ] of these authorities
it still has the ~ second ] largest military spending in the world it has a technologically advanced and innovative defence sector and yet we are still unable to translate these opportunities into a workable and coherent security policy
the technological military and economic logic of a more integrated % eu ] defence policy is inescapable but the problem is exquisively political
! one ] thing is to a difference from the other then let me tell you something that is very important
the report makes reference and emphasises rightly and the security defends and political challenges that % russia ] approvides for the % european union ]
i am probably much more important just witness the political maddling in the & brexit ] process or a number of ) european ] general elections so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider and this is not an issue for nator 's eastern flank this is a larger play to that we need to deal with the second and probably much more important
much as i would like to avoid this we cannot simply support this fight as it stands now
obligation for bilateral individual responsibility member states
it is very much thank you very much
i do not think i need to remind my honourable colleagues that that particular article is not traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response

so my last few years a few ~ seconds ] i would like to call upon my colleagues make sure that we deliver a broad majority for a strong proposal and do not take it appart during the vote on @ wensday ]
the % eu ] is the world 's largest provider of development and humanitarian assistance and with the adoption of a @ gender two thousand and thirty ] @ last september ] in % new york ] we all committed to the implementation of the news obstainable development goals
as the situation in * europe ] has a toriority dramatically i think that the news are sustainable development goes should take a step further and adopt strong objectives to effectives the enormity of the crisis while addressing the root causes of migration in the countries of origin
we want to make sure that the funds achieve their purpose to build sustainable economies health services educational facilities create jobs and give future to people in their own countries
madam president development policy is key in achieving more inclusive and peaceful world by uniting global efforts to improve people 's lives worldwide and eradicate poverty
in a situation where we should raise public awareness in * europe ] on the question of the research programme and specifically of its important for jobbing growth and my question would be since we in the midst of the discussions now on the trilogue on that issue
following the & arab spring ] the international shareholders of the ` eib ] decided to increase the collabour capital so that the ` eib ] could extend its operation into countries such as % egypt ] initially % madam president ] this does you was considered non contribursial and the ` european council ] did not amend it how
this has produced a fast stronger text which recognises the responsibility of the representatives of the % eu ] share holding in the bank and reinforces the recent forces the recent forest and the direction of our involvement in this institution
about beneficiaries and impact of its financial intermediary operation furthermore as a result of the committee 's amendments the governor of the ` eib ] added for the % union ] should now report annually to the ` parliament ] on ` promotion of the union ] 's objectives with regard to the % eu ] 's external action policy the % eu ] two thousand and twenty strategy and the & singh nifincent increase ] of the transfer of renewable energy
in the resolution we also address the case of the leading civil society activists some parts of foreign who disappeared in @ december ]
@ two thousand and twelve ] he was oligitally adapted by the police and we are still not seeing any reaction of the last government
in compliance with the opinion from @ organs two thousand and seventeen ] of the ` un ] working group on & arbitrary dist tention ] we call for the immediate and unconditional release
i do welcome the idea of a leader state which was announced recently at the stage and which was announced recently at
mr president vital transaction systems are constantly being improved in order to safetime and effort for users but their security is in my opinion a reason to remain vigilant
many people are easily tricked into revealing personal information online and into making unsecured transactions with ~ third ] parties and the times
that is why i think the most important measures that should be taken out raising user warness regarding internet transactions unity
in the midst of this ) european ] debt crisis we always take the decision to fiscal sum more now and create that for the future
we have a very intensive ! five ] bonds behind us but i am really proud to have been a part of this process we have tried a lot together this regulation is a good example of what the % european union ] can achieve if there is a political will
under the new regulation the management of the external borders of the % european union ] will be the shared responsibility of the member states in the % european union ]
! one ] of the pliorities of our group was to ensure that the agency has a big role in search and rescue at sea
this situation will be improved by the new regulation
~ third ] and rescue peration will be an important complement of ) european ] integrated border management
the agency starts with supporting member states in carrying out these operations
i know that the ados who have not convinced about this new agency
i share some of the reconsumers
this crisis has been brought about as we all know by the kind of casino capitalism crony capitalism and a financial service sector that has been subjected to no regulation or at light touch regulation as it is sometimes politically referred to and the follows of all of this for workers and families across * europe ] have been nothing short of catastrophic and i am struck chair in the debate and in the reports that have been produced at the very police way in which we are addressing this scandal
the fact is that the % eu ] response to the financial crisis has been sloggished has been minimised
i am struck at the fact that the liberals and ) christian ] democratic groups are concerned at over prescription or that protectionism may be introduced through the back door
the fact is that we do in fact require a representative protectionism and those that must be protected or workers and the real economy
we found ourselves in a rather than a debate in a professional debate and in political debate
clear commitments regarding and well assessment of the work done by this recordinisation
a public money ! forty three million ] airline will be used for cofinancing of ! three ] non profit organisations which deliver public goods as international financial reporting standards foundation which resilient or national accounting standards border
the public interest of our side board which of us is international oda ethics and educational standards for the accounting professions * europe ] and financial reporting advicery group effort the technical adviser of the ` european commission ]
it is about the quality of financial information in the decision making process
develops international financial reporting standards
the question of independence of the standard issues and the governance of this organisation
i fel respondation and i see the % eu ] will take measure for interest disclosure in order to avoid conflict of interest
and where appropriate proposal for irrest regulation changes
we have now created in showing schemes and other schemes to deal with the impaired assets
* europe ] has led the way in so many other areas it is now time to lead the way in creating the global institutions that will deal with the global problems we have and provide global solutions
that
whatever the views in this ` parliament ] i think people will go a face up to that is what they say
i believe that whatever the different views expressed in this ` parliament ] there is a will across the people of this world to do that and we are a major role in it
we have changed fundamentally and we need institutions that reflect a global economy in the way it operates and deals with the problems we have
we are domestic competition and we are domestic competition
mr president i think that we have got realised the spite of the different political views in this ` parliament ] is that global cooperation is not just in banking institutions but global cooperation in other areas and physical and monetary policy and for trade have got to be a very important part of how we approach the future
there are global problems that need global solutions
more manufacturing is being done in asia than in * europe ]
other countries have not done that
we found that banks that we thought were independent were completely entangled with other banks in different countries and we have to deal with that problem
for us to sit apart to be a loof and not to cooperate with other countries is a recipe for failure and for an inability to solve a problem that is actually a global banking failure that is spread across the industrial economy
if we do not understand the problem we will not be able to understand the solution we had a power cut right across the banking system right across the world
~ first ] of all that it is important that the world comes together to deal with this crisis
whatever the party political lines that people want to adopt on this is the truth we have to deal with a problem of global banking restructuring
we capitalise our banks
i have got to do that and i believe that the lesson of this crisis is that we are now in a global economy
like or like it not the world is changing incredibly at fast
i am sure or try to ensure that the international monitor fund had the resources that were necessary to deal with the problems of economies that could not at the moment sustain themselves when there was a flight of capital
i think that comes out from this discussion for it for me is it to have global solutions to global problems we will also not just need our ) european ] institutions to be strong but our global institutions to be strong but our global institutions to be strong
more than a children dollars has been spent in recapitalising banks across the world
that will require us to shape global institutions and my message to this ` parliament ] is very clear
i have asked whether the world bank and other international institutions can help countries whether it is substantial poverty being created as a result of the crisis
there is trade around the world at a speed that we have never seen before until this crisis and we have got to deal with that by creating a global trading environment which is free but also fair
this is a test of how we have having over @ the last sixty years ] grated a * europe ] which has social protection as well as economic progress can help shape a world where we have economic progress in violent all care and social justice at the same time
mr president all member states have very distinct legal courters
the legal system of the % uk ] is very different to the rest of continental * europe ]
a blanket policy cannot work in this % union ]
it stands me to see this report is calling on the commission to urge member of states to ensure the strict enforcement of % eu ] rules on the free movement of persons the % eu ] cannot force an % eu ] migration policy on countries who are already dealing with very difficult internal problems such as housing and financial commitments
i also note with concern that the emphasis of this report is on bringing sovereign nations states back into line
the report 's references to ensure that the % eu ] institutions themselves comply with % eu ] law could almost be a bligatory
this is not a periphery matter
this report like the % eu ] institutions themselves has failed to consider who guards the guards
this was a sign of mutual respect
your commitment in your commissioner for your commitment in your tough tone which led to the ~ first ] march agreement and ` council ] situations
we have been following the developments very anciously in % brussels ] and in * europe ] and yet the % eu ] has made tremendous efforts to act as a mediator between the parties
@ last december ] only @ two months ] after the positive commission progress report we experienced a major political crisis in the former ) us ] last republic of % macedonia ] the opposition was keeped out of the plenary journalist had been expressed previously voting to place without their presence
let us continue to work hard keeping the country on the ) european ] trade track
the whole political process was disrupted due to ` parliamentary blocking ] for many weeks
this is very much deplorable but my programme is that this debate is somewhat out of the context of urgencies because at the same time we know that during this year in % iran ] at a time more people have been executed
combat and barrier have decided to have a more authorium on execution for @ the past six years ] and this is something encouraging
it is the only way people have to express their views about our coming projects
the commission proposal is a reinforcing this directive
furthermore we ask more social assidation
i think it tells you all you know about the % uk ] in the peninsulation
if you want to get rid of all this problems you mention this is not the right way
it will increase cost and it will be less competitive for ) european ] market and for the smes that you believe that you are protecting
the same promise thanks to the determination and hard work of many of us will bear good fruits
i ask for your broad support in the vote @ tomorrow ]
we prove today that the % european union ] can deliver concrete results for the citizens all over * europe ] bringing positive changes in our daily lives but for the full completion of the digital single market we still need many reforms and a lot of work
we need to do our best to break down national cycles
there is no place for protectionism in our common ) european ] market
the next step we should take is harmonisation of the via tea roles we also need to unify cooperate protection rules and open up the services market in the oda regional sector
i hope that the ` council ] will help us in these efforts as for us in ` parliament ] i hope to see this project in the forefront of our agenda
already now i am looking forward to the review in @ two years ] which you have just mentioned mr } vice president ]
@ two thousand and seventeen ] this forum will neighbour for the ~ first ] time an exchange of use between all concerned actors such as consumer representative in the strategies of the supply chain member states authorities and the commission some of you have called on the commission to propose a specifical legislation to prohibit the outcome it is an especifical legislation to prohibi the outcome it
the commission intends to provide a result of this mep for the next high level forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain on @ two thousand and fifteen ] in line with the conclusion of the ` european council ] of @ nine hundred and seven march ]
so far the commission has received ! twenty one ] replies from the member states
the establishment of a simple effective and transparent evaration mechanism complementing the current schengen evaluation is a most welcome initiative
burden elections will be a sensible short term compromise in such as trade and offering both sides a democratic solution
mr president a demand of the ` council ] should then appeal to the principle of subsidiarity since we are dealing with % european ] elections not with local regional or national elections we are in the fight against ` parliament ] and ` electoral law resolution ] has been very shy
without showing a true ambition to adapt deroctor system according to the new social and political demands for greater participation accountability and equality
we understand the urgency of producing a new law on the important subject of ) european ] elections
our electoral rules
as it is institution taking the final decision on nortification by the union of any international treaty
however the quality of the ` council ] decision depends to a large extend on the quality of the proposal submitted treaty
as i have said discussions on the competence is a very difficult and sensitive one
we have had several rounds of discussion in attempts to find a solution
to find ! one ] flexibility needs to be shown by everyone and i will repeat it by everyone
a measure that could significantly facilitate unbooking the situation is a legislative proposal by the commission to adopt the % eu ] legal framework to the & market treaty ] ahead of the ` council ] decision on the conclusion of the market treaty
what would not be helpful or productive ease to suspend our discussion to start languagely covered procedures
i will conclude by saying that the ) marici ] treaty has been included in the agenda of the foreign affairs consumer that takes place @ monday ] @ next week ]
you should not be able to sector agenda or frame our political responses let alone frame our future you should stop putting people against each other and stop lying about migrants and refugees and should stop confuse migrants and terrorists
it is beyond all dignity and sense
smugglers are sisted because there is a lack of legal pathways
we externalise borders the way we see that some people here want to do is not to save people
we need to open more legal pathways
the problem however is that our current policy seems not to be working
these are together with & arms ] negotiations of the emff
we must try to defend it and make every effort to further increase its effectiveness
for example in @ fatca ] @ february two thousand and seventeen ] we published a staft document to express our approach
new alliances are necessary including with big consumer countries especially % china ] and with financial institutions
finally the commission raised awareness on the importance of language learning through public events like the european day of languages on @ twenty six hundred ] and the national awards of the ) european ] language labour for innovative language learning projects
in high lighting the complexity brought about by language diversity and fundamental importance of language technologies on the road to achieving language equality the report provides food for thought for developing future actions
@ two years later ] the three years later to see what comes out and the conclusion is clear the work fixed to work done
good results and even with more capacity to perform in the future
special times special situation each special situation each special measure
of course i do favour and of course exactly those second as the european social fabric which have been the victims of a long protracted discrimination in history of course the rome is community not only but let me say that making up the budget is not only a matter in this house of a single ) european ] political group and of course i do favour i do favour the favour of course i do favour ideophobe
i wanted to tell you that in the current dispensation of the european budget there is a ! twenty ] or social inclusion including in the ) european ] social fund
ever since the great recession got started with socialists have fought all along the way against the recessive austerity and in favour of that ) european ] budget in order to fight social exclusion
mr president thank you subsidiarity and proportionately this seems to be the past and president } macroe ] if we let him do it so we change the structure and the strategies and everything of the % european union ] eff
he wants a united states of * europe ] while we ) european ] people want a * europe of nations ] of independent nations with surveillance
we majority of * europe ] do not want migration
on the ! one ] side there is my country } hungary ] with the victim right their countries representing clearly the majority of ) european ] citizens
the important thing is that they should speak up much more loudly
still if we want to protect * europe ] and our countries and our communities together honger the victim group 's countries and the citizens really of * europe ] please speak up wherever you can and support honger
to the time we all have come for the bank to adopt an optidate responsible taxation policy and that would involve ! three ] measures during the exercise of the bank 's due diligence particularly for intermediaries which as my colleague } goberrie ] said for a particular problem
! first ] points which motivates many of the requests that have been made of the bank
in all of our interests for example that the fiscal capacity of member states is preserved and that the % eu ] 's aid policy is not undermined by tax leaking away from developing countries
~ first ] we need the bank to make use of the measures contained within the & anti money laundering directive ] and particularly to access the new registers of beneficial ownership of companies
the bank did in @ two thousand and nine ] become a pine here when it is adopted a policy against non cooperative jurisdictions but as we all know that policy has lost many of its teeth as those jurisdictions have creatively complied with the letter of ` oecd ] requirements rather than complying with their spirits
this makes them an indispensable sector in a stabilising ) european ] economy increasing jobs and growth in * europe ]
unfortunately the current instruments are insufficient and do not provide smes especially micro and small enterprises with the necessary means to find answer instruments
mr president for as long as i have been a member of the ` european parliament ] i have repeated a call on the member states and the commission to join their efforts and tackle the root causes of migration which is the only way forward to provide a genuine response to the migration crisis in the % eu ] and % inafrica ] the fund launched at the voluntary summit on migration which is designed to help foster stability in the ) african ] regions and contribute to better migration management
most importantly the fund will help address the root causes of irregular migration by stimulating investments boostics are senible growth and draw creation in ) african ] countries where most migrants come from
we have to ensure accountability transparency and proper management of funds
we have to ensure well planned investments so that the proposed ( billions ] really benefit the citizens and projects which improve education healthcare and infrastructure
of course the ` european parliament ] does not the commission is fully transparent in all negotiations and that we are provided with timely sectoral impact assessment
i believe that this opportunity should be used by ` parliament ] to strongly support an & fta ] with % gapan ] for the following reasons the % european union ] and % gapan ] are industrial giants that share democratic values and together represent
economic benefits are clear
we share similar challenges the rise of china and the global financial crisis decreasing the demographics the need to access romaterials and energy sources and to achieve price debate
in addition we will support bilateral safeguard measures as was the case with the south carrier fta to avoid serious injury to the sensitive sectors such as automotives allegation and machinary
therefore i see great potential in food of developing trade relations with % g pan ] our ! sixth ] largest trading patter
i would like to rate await that nontarive borriers and public procurement are crucial areas for ) european ] businesses where % german ] needs to make significant concessions
however unfortunately the practice shows that there are always companies operating within the % eu ] that will try to circumvent the rules to gain questionable advantages
they create many jobs in * europe ] and make important investments that is true
most of your money is more than your
much of the credit for that goes to the rapporteur and the ` ecr ] will support this report in cleanery
not just motherhood and apple py to use the ) american ] expression but it is of some real value
there are already countries in the process whose political systems give lessons through full throat and support to the democratic freedoms and plurality needed for effective university sector and the admission of belarus would give even more cause for concern over the confidence we want to have in the process
the legacy is repression isolation and corruption and there is an expectation about the new transition government although it is chaired by a former vice president } mugabe ] himself with the ` angoa ]
it is probably it is probably even a good thing that precisely at this time when we are reconsidering our strategic ` carliship ] with * africa ] we should get the chance to prove what we can actually mean in reconstituting a democratic state in the * southern part of the african continent ] and in helping it along a both democratic state in the * southern part of the ) african ] continent and in helping it a long both democratic state in the * southern part of the ) african ] continent and in helping it a long both democratically and economically
% zimbabwe ] has them a tremendous possibilities that it could use in its relationship with * europe ]
so it is there any other statute
this is a disaster
has to be solved somehow
it is a matter responsibility of my country % hungary ]
we are not the ones we are going to salve it we are going to continue protecting our country and protecting the schengen borders of * europe ] in accordance with our obligations
~ first ] i would like to commend your efforts to increase the overall approach safety by the initiative to include new adviance safety features in @ two cost ] and trucks
~ thirdly ] and finally i do regret that your proposal for a regulation on electronic freight transport information did not come a little bit earlier in the ~ first ] nobility package because it could have served as a solid legal base for the enforcement part of the & lexbon sia ] it is unposting over the capitalist and posting off the capital responsibilities
we must make sure that they are going to be accessible to every future car owner because safety must not become a privilege of luxury car owners
but i would like to ask you mr } giggle ] what do you think will happen if countries like % sweden ] } denmark ] pollen will be outside the banking union
mr president on behalf of my group i want to request that this package of reports be struck from the agenda of this sanction
i think mr president that this house should show some measure of humanity and some respect for the democratic process
we all know that % ireland ] has rejected the ) lisbon ] treaty and so it is of some wonder meant to me that this house persists in debating that matter
it is not democratically appropriate that this house would set a saudi to the veritic of % ireland ] or that this house would be used to ratious operational uniland in the coming months to adopt a treaty that is clearly not in our interests or in the interests of the ) european ] people
very often in economic difficult times young people unfortunately get into drug abuse
it is possible that the ` european social fund ] could be used in a targeted way to try and help young people consider it and the problems that this causes not only to themselves individuals but to their families and to their communities which can have very severe effect on communities
the % eu ] is built on the nation that we are stronger together and that fundamental rights and values must never be an issue up for cromp compromise
however i am worried about the current development at the same time and we see attacks on the independent media and educative tried people we see attacks on women and we see attacks on
i welcome of course the new rule of law report presented @ last week ] but we need to come further
resolutions suggest important measurable goals involvement of civil society and abroader scope to also include fundamental rights and democracy we must make sure that % eu ] does not remain at too thless tiger because this report is good but we need to make sure to provide it with teath
one of the best way of providing the type of with teath is through a stronger conditionality link to the budget
