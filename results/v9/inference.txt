i think that is the biggest benefit we can already see from this agreement
they can agree governments doing what they can at to help and member states are supporting it

is no past route and no citizenship by investment
what is the order so to say in this respect
this situation will be improved by the new regulation
so we make sure that we make it more open and inclusive less formal opinion to make sure that we make it more open and inclusive less formal opportunities
