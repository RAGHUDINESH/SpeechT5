mr president ~ first ] of all i would like to thank all members of the ` raff attition base ]
i look forward to continuing to work with you on their forthcoming proposal and bringing it to a successful concld
we all agree in the last session in strasbourg that development is important but we need to remember it now we
we need to invest introduce neighbours of development and yes most of all we all
they are ready to give ! thousands ] of euros to traffickers because there is not
migrants are not even extremely poor but they are all
if we get back for example to the issue of migration we will see that this is the key question of governance
forward to war but also the lack of freedom and bad governance is what makes desperate people to undertake dangerous journeys in the search for a better life in * europe ] and development cooperation is part of the answer to this child
in all these efforts ahead of the ~ third ] international conference in % al asaber ] we need to be aware of the finance alone will not be sufficient policies are of fundamental importance in achieving sustainable development goals we need policies that will ensure that financial resources are used effectively
furthermore we need a completely new approach to financing development
this is a ~ first ] regulative act which will provide police in all member
i suppose and i am sure that the end of this commission is not beginning a discussion because it is really very complicated package and i do not think that all of how
we have to be ready for that
it does not mean that we have to be technologically ahead of technology we have to be very firm and argue it is the fundamental rights of people to be people as an economy
the economy technology is ahead of

could we do more and could you perhaps be more specific what has done so far what are
mr president i also want to raise the issue of respect of religious freedom of foreign without discrimination because this
efsi also concludes to the accoupt of ! twenty one ] objectives to keep sustainable development and environment objectives in mind efsi also increases the local presence
we all know that some member states will do their best to
we took many measures to improve the situation and i believe
with climate change bringing more extreme waste events we need to be able to protect human lifes and valuable assets and make our regions our cities and our targets more
as for energy @ three years ago ] the % eu ] had sure government decided to set the current * eu ] to sovereignty opportunities as a clear deadline for the completion of internal energy
well orders on tax the commission action plans have been published
it also says clearly that it urges the member states which are absent here not to impose any obligation on encryption providers that would result in the weakening or composing of the security of their networks or devices such as the creator a creation
for the % eu ] the immediate challenge is to help ensure a fair and inclusive electoral process and be prepared for a range of sina
but we should not lose sight of the
the ) irish ] system works within a legal and regulatory policy directory
% ireland ] is no worse or no better than any other place but i object to hostile commons about % ireland ] eminating from % london new york ] and the % german ]
all these places have experienced regularly and banking challenges and problems equal to and in many cases far worse than what we have faced done
the constant sniping from some of our % eu ] neighbours has been based on prejudice rather than objective fact and those little for the % eu ] solidarity at a time when * europe ] is going through enormous financial
much for the question
raising funds for research and care addressing discrimination at work and advocating for policy change with decision makers all depend on previous awareness and understands
our choice tomorrow is to go for a strong mandate with a bun and go for negotiations or go for negotiations using as a starting point on mandate and end up with something
in exchange we go the protection of the vulnerable
mr president @ one month ] after we voted our compromise the ` council ] did not put it on the agenda did not even present it i use this time to talk with the member
if this compromise is further what a done it will become meaningly
if you want to change the rules in ` parliament ] of the balance of the countries you have to change it ~ first ] in the ` council ] and then we will see finally as you say i fully understand the position of the ` council ] in the speece and candidate
the ` council ] will have to approve its programme which
finally you have been in the % us ] @ last week ] and finally you have been in the % us ]
we new have a date to give us today on the shopping
in this report we strongly support the independence of the commission and the national commission authorities
what with the commissioner 's among them was with commitment
as you know this is a non binding report but it sends a strong political message to the
@ two thousand and thirteen ] this may be the last competition report of this term @ next year
yet the importance of our ` parliament ] ship with the ` eib ] and with the % european union ] in meeting our commitments both to our shadow risks and to our countries of operations is clearer
~ second ] under the aggress of the % european union ] new structures of cooperation between ` ebrd ] and ` eib ] offer great new opportunities for us to work
these initiatives facilitated by ec funds bring us together to work concretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and as such offer an excellent crucible work
with this wide range of stakeholders we are working together to implement the plan and are developing the coordination and cooperation mechanisms to do so and we see as we saw last organised and faced with a conflict driven banking crisis in
~ third ] i take the ` european parliament ] 's views as welcome in put to the early stages of the ` eib ] 's forthcapital resources review which we will conclude at our annual meeting in
faced with the dramatic decline and private flows of credit we came together @ last month ] with the world bank group to launch the joint ) irish ] action plan and support of banking systems and lending to the real economy in central and
an increase of more
~ first ] the context of the financial and economic crisis renders any encouragement of greater cooperation between ` ebrd ] and ` eib ] more relevant than ever
at the same time we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is
@ two thousand and ten ] the ` eib ] has taken a pro active stance in response to the crisis supporting our clients and countries of operations we are expanding our instruments and aiming to invest ( eur seven billion ]
yet the crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy driven respiration but a vital necessity
the full implications of the current situation on our portfolio and the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen
i believe it is in this context that we may find divisions of labour applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation including common standards which
that this kind of our vice cooperation borne of need is the kind that we express
i refer in particular to the * western bulgarian ] 's investment framework now being launched as well as the ` czech ] ` eastern partnership ] announced by the ` european council ] in @ recent days ] which will build on the good cooperation we have already established
the action plan recognises that an effective crisis response in * europe ] 's integrated financial markets requires fast and coordinated action by all stakeholders parent banks which own a large part of the region 's financial
mr president what worries me most is the suggestion that the ` european investment bank ] has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis that it can somehow act as the ) europe ] wide body to provide stimulate where member states
i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial trigs
the ` eib ] has a leverage of about ! thirty five ] times and its shareholders are member state
if it were to go bast like some of our commercial banks the report even encourages the ` eib ] and the commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative and
the danger is that if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments as has been suggested that its enviable high credit rate may be down graded like some of our governments
however i would stress that the commission has neither the capacity nor the desire to lead the delivery of the action plan itself
the implementation of the action plan will require real cooperation commitment and leadership from member states and regional stakeholders to the leader the attitude or so projects included at this
this rapid progress is important if we are to maintain momentum as we answer the implementation of
this is the only way to ensure that the ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the member states and
the commission very much expects ` parliament ] to be actively involved in events such as the
the ~ first ] formal assessment of progress made will be presented under the policy
this will give all stakeholders an opportunity to consider how the ~ first ] months of the strategy have gone and what lessons might be drawn into
that coordination monitoring and reporting is done by the commission and the implementation on the ground is led by the member states or the organisations of the )
i would now like to say a few words about the planned governance system which is proposed for an operational implementative
this is ! one ] area wherever there has been much discussion among the member states but the overall approach is that the policy orientations will be taken about
the boldest system strategy has equired a completely new approach for the commission as it is the ~ first ] time we have prepared an integrated strategy for a group of member states who have to face
in financial terms although there is no editional financing from the % eu ] budget the strategy proposes a more coordinated use of existing funds and a more imaginative approach to other funding sources such as the
of course it is not a complete surprise to me that ` parliament ] is taking such an interest in the
@ next year ]
i would like to conclude by saying that i look forward to continuing to work closely with the ` european parliament ] on all objects
the ) swedish ] presidency has led positive and constructive discussions in the ` council ] which are to lean
here we expect to see a wave of coordination meetings to kicks target the various priorities
responsibility must rest with the relevant member states and other stateholders directly involved on the
your backing is crucial to maintain ways throughout visibility for strategy to maintain highlevel level political support for strategy and to maintain pressure on the member states and the regional actors to deliver
in addition the commission proposals to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties
i would like to underline this point as it must be clear that all our preparator work on the strategic framework that i have just discriminate will count for not unless we start to deliver genuine visible concrete results on the
the population of * europe ]
the majority are fed up with mess migration they do not want any more migrants and they want to send back those who are now here
we are on ! one ] side and on the other side there is the whole corruptor political alient the thing is the majority of the citizens of * europe ] cannot really speak up because they are punished there are all these haspeech laws which
we do have freedom of speech and we speak up for the majority of citizens of * europe ] but they should also speak up and they should
mr president could i say that the commission showed a good understanding of the construction industry
i would emphasise the need for more sea marking absolutely essential we do not want to see any more national standards and i wish this whole process every success for the
all i would say is that i think it is a larger percentage of the overall ` gdp ] something like the @ two thousand and thirteen ] of materials are ! four ] or ! five ] or ! seven ] so it is a very important sector it was a privilege @ today ] by
a very important measure in a very important
the construction industry does need a regulation after @ twenty years ] of having the directive in place
it is evident that gender equality must be main streamed in all policy responses to the crisis in all education and training policies in the european social fund and in other programmes social and
i have in mind a council with a wider mandate covering all economic social environmental and human development
now we should do the same in the % european
i think that we should pay a lot of attention to development issues also in that
for me personally the most important achievements in this report are the recommendations on the substantial strengthening of the economic social environmental and development dymental
by developing it into a sustainable development
my report includes several proposals for strengthening the role of the % united nations system ] in global governance and for improving the possibilities of the % european union ] and its member states to better achieve our
these ideas got the lot of support in the negotiations but not enough in order to
i proposed that the ` council ] would have permanent members to the % european union ] % us ] aid chapter and the ) brexit ] countries and rotating once
according to the report this must be done in the ~ first ] instance by means of structural and functional reform of the economic and social ` council ] but we also call on the % eu ] institutions and the member
mr president i would like to propose in a speech to the world economic ` council ] in double this
in the negotiations on my % eu ] % un ] report i failed to emphasise the importance of security dimension of the % united nations ] we were reluctant to strengthen the other parts of the
we do appreciate the own resources although we would have wanted to have more ambitiously
we have made an agreement in the framework of the ` united nations ] and it is called smes and in your introduction mr } kommittee ] mr } kompar ] mentioned the states and i think it is so extremely important that we use these bodies to make sure that all the money that we spend in all these sectors are used to come up with good results on the sustainable developmenc
all extensive scales is no longer just a due discipline
it is now a matter of human competiton
this should be immediately in that condition of % eu ] release on the

we have hammered out an effective and workable regulation now let us show everybody that we argue

so we want to hear clearly what the commission
we talk in this house about performance based burdening
in @ two thousand and twenty three ] where can i explain to my voters that * europe ] delivers that * europe ] have a better regulation that * europe ] has an open * euro ]
so this is a question breaking committee once a bring forward and i hope that you can come over with at least a clear message because it was so silent
~ second ] depending on this outcome of any of ) church ] anticipated performance review is the commission willing to release the performance 's reserves
we have our elections and we made our negotiations @ in the year two thousand and thirteen ] in
@ two thousand and seventeen ] in @ eighteen ] there we spent and now we have to wait to thousand and nineteen for having a valuation and then this is
we have to speak
in this context i support the idea of drawing letting ) america ] and * africa ] more deeply into the existing transatlantic dialogue colleagues it is sometimes said that the % eu ] faces the choice between tightening our strategic partnership with the us or working towards more
but it is a false choice
at the ` european council ] do its part of the job
we ~ first ] have % ireland ] a veteran forty five years in the % european union ] but now we have creating
many of us here are convinced that * europe ] the % european union ] has been in a protracted crisis striving in
it is about the lack of vision to face with a ) european ] fashion the ) eurozone ] needs globalisation and most notably refugee crisis
it is completely different
@ two thousand and fourteen ] @ two thousand and twenty ] will the experience of @ two thousand
this renewed policy definitively leads to more local and ) european ]
and clarify the effects of the late start for the @ next year ] 's emphasis to be
the ex ante conditionality should formulate it leading to more integrated policy and a better structured and targeted results
i am something you in this house
we need a new payment plan at
we see commitments in the social field especially for younger people to
@ two thousand and three ] i ask you to include ! three ] respects in this cohesion master plan taking away the hinderances in the expenditure of the internet
member states were still working on to finalise their programmes and it came with very late agreed programmes for
to practical reflection and the relation of it to ) european ] semester is established cohesion concerns with ! three ] forthcoming the country specific recommendations and we made a performance
this house will agree on
in the resolution is the clear request we are now doubting and you could hear it @ today ] also that you want to have a mass deprivement on a silarity and
and this means that you look at tellops honestly what does it mean if you start
mr president is just to say
@ two thousand and sixteen ] the ` council ] protects and supports the budget for instruments that spurve growth and thereby create jobs namely such instruments as ` erc
concerning subheding mandate economic social and territorial cohesion which is another core policy of the % european union ] for the creation of growth and jobs the ` council ] proposes limited the reductions of payment appropriations on new programmes of ( eur one hundrred
@ two thousand and sixteen ] the ` council ] has accepted in full all appropriations destined to programmes and agencies dealing with the crisis including the use of the flexibility instrument for an amount of firmly the enthry million ] of
frankly the ` council ] and the member states are very concerned to note that all institutions will achieve that go therefore the ` council ] has made it very clear in a statement that it expects that all efforts are deployed to avoid any additional delays in implementing these
this means that we wish to finance educate link investments to spare growth and jobs for example through the european fund for strictering investments and to provide sufficient funding to tackle the steel ongoing migration crisis and
so you can see that the ` council ] stands fully behind the ) european ]
@ two thousand and sixteen ] programmes and instruments that are related to the migration crisis and the facility for refugees in % turkey ] were not affected
that bed lock should be fully absorpt by the end of this year in accordance
global * europe ] the ` council ] undertook a thorough analysis in order to identify space for creating the necessary margin since the commission 's proposal for @ two thousand nd
i would like to begin by stating clearly that the main trust of the ` council ] 's position is the prioritisation of expenditure
as you can see in an effort to find the right balance between the one hand a sustainable budget in times of budgetary constraints the drain throughout * europe ] and on the other hand financing a shared sential political priorities the
in those areas that cannot be qualified as stopped political priorities in the current circumstances reductions in the proposal of the commissioner 's reply in a careful fashion in order not to harm programmes that
subhering money however has also contributed to the general saving savings set for concerning some budget lines where the ` council ] considers following a detailed technical analysis that the commission has over stimulated the rea
i think this commission shows that we may have some different views but in general we are united by the fact that we want to have a workable budget a good budget
for the @ seventeen ] and we want to keep the main focus of these discussions on @ two thousand nand
* european ] surviving global economy only as a competitive
if i may just very briefly to some of the important points which were made during
looking forward to our cooperation
madam president it should change as we have in that we have too many priorities and too little money and the question is how we use the money in the best possible
all the people have to feel our assistance
we have to stop all supplies of military equipments to the undemocratic governments in
of course we have to be ready careful enough to support the forces and movements with smes ideolo
we have to have a united ) european ] position
on @ ten of september two thousand and nine ] @ last week ] the commission adopted a communication on stepping up international climate finance which aims at speeding up the international legations
in this respect it is worth mentioning the global partnership on technology which aims at doubling investment in local
with ! two hundred and fifty ] fifty pages of negotiating tax on the table the negotiations we have not yet gathered sufficient momentum to come to an agreement that is ambitious and detailed
however among most parties there is a sense of federative and the greeningness to focus on areas of convergence
money will make or break the deal we need to mobilise private investment and promote the establishment of a robust international carbon market but substantial public funding
furthermore we have to strengthen support to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the increasing adverse effects of crime
there is a doubting task ahead of fast with the intense negotiations of recoming months but failure is not an option
we need comparable and more ambitious emissions reduction targets for the group of developed candidates which in agriculture today offer less than ! fifteen ] of the network of
it is not only that it is also the other carset as we have been cheating and the differences in the different member states like some of them are mandatory the others are voluntary some are only on the national carbon carbon carboard
how will you do that
we also have to look to the future and yes we have to care about our car industry but a new area is coming it will be electrified it will be sharing mobility and if we do not make sure that we do that for our industry that we do not make sure that we have a zero emission mandate then the charter will be important
! three million ] cars have not been recalled yet
how should the commission make sure that all consumers in * europe ] have the same right
i actually restrict the access to the % eu ] market affording which could be a consequence of such extensive regulations
a regulation could really harm the economies of developing war and could actually cost jobs there
@ ten weeks ago ] tabilisation and association agreement entered force
! one ] political development is that reducing corruption and organised crime and making judiciary more efficient has been assessed as good by the commission
a lot has already been said about the magnitude of this right 's violation and about the relevance of the topic trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed with a human rights faced and victim centred
victims and vulnerable populations need to be put at the centre of all efforts
the prevention of trafficking in human beings and the protection of its victims must all
access to transition support measures shelter and education need to be ensured independent of the victims willingness to cooperate in criminal proceedings
the principle of non criminalisation in this regard is also vital and needs to be implemented in all member
further demand needs to be techniques
accountability needs to be ensured for both offenders
for the new strategy i think that financial investigations and action against money laundering need to play a bigger part in fighting trafficking in human beings and to ensure that confiscated sets are used to support and compensate victims of trafficking
does the commission agree on this and how does it intend to address this in the new strategy
i am vorried about the trend of trafficking in human beings being mixed up with other legally distinct concepts such as migrant smuggling increasingly addressing trafficking in human beings through a security link for instance in the &
how will the commission count on this strength in its new strategy
i also call for greater internal external coherence in the fight against trafficking in human beings and to further enhance and deepen cooperation in coordination among all relevant activists
that would give the enlargement a more prominent presence supplementing the usual progress reports for the countries
therefore i sincerely welcome the commission 's strategy and the action plan as documents which will officially and permanently put a vestment balk on the large mandate on
it became also clear that we simply cannot wait for all major political issues to be settled before we endeavour
or this could provide a strong political better job for the difficult work that evades on all sides in order to welcome the frontrunner countries % syria ] and %
additionally i would call the commission to draw up annual reports concerning the implementation of this strategy and the action plan which should be discussed here in the
it is important not just for the countries of the region but also for the % european union ] itself because without providing a credible perspective for full membership for all the countries of the * western bulgans ] the % eu ] global role will not be credible because
we need to invest more both politically and financially yes it is a difficult process because enlargement is at
at the same time there is always an alternative we should not forget and the alternative is embracing nationalism and populism and creating rival risk and hostility again

i am recent participant in the twitter side and i have to say that i am more than surprised and impressed about how much information is it on that side from the % european union ] it is a huge amount of information

the strong risk based approach offers the best way forward here these challenges are difficult but i fully support the effect the effect the efforts of all the rapporteurs here @ today ] and we are not even close to setisfying legal situation but risky
and some people born in a different time like myself might want to go back to how it was before because it seems
the future will be more digital not less and it brings incredible progress that we as policy makers should be
but we cannot ignore any more
let us be honest with each other colleagues the % eu ] has done more to regulate the own line world
over the past degates we have not followed up illegal content and illegal activities online with the same
we have not achieved any meanful transparency overhall elegations but to content to users on a messive
we have not grasped the impact of it on our democracies our culture and our fundamental rights
instead we have focused on voluntary cooperation which is good but not
not nearly good enough
we cannot live this over to the private sector without oversight and enforcement we must keep this in the public debate as a priority and we must arregulate no matter how typical
the difficult challenge before us is to find a balance between digital progress and respect of indemental
the value of law making is the real charter change its effects
if we start off with conflicting regulations and directives that undermine each other instead of complementing each otch
we must respect the scope of each digital
~ secondly ] the financing of the e commerce directive were great but its greatest issue was transparency
we must improve and enforce meanful transparency and i call for a clear mandate from

let me outline briefly what the commission is already doing to improve
we are worried by the & deteriorating situation ] when it comes to respect for human rights persecution of political opponents as well as journalists that
mr president who are depriving the people of % fangual ] of their basic human rights access to healthcare full education by still in public money intended for basic social services we are seriously concerned about the possible mismanagement of % eu ] development funds by the ` local authorities ] and in this regard we are requesting from the commission to review the & national indicative ]
mr president after the case of conflict in stability and goal accontinues to face major challenges if we
however it should be a decision taken by the % eu ] as a whole and of course coordinating
it is important that & fatca book ] is not only doing adds as they say is their business model but also deliver for trust in a way of delivering solutions and actions in the way of how they do their
i would also agree it is very important to understand that there is a missing brick in this wall and that is the privacy regulation
we need to get more rules and place especially also for consumer control to get connectivity across the platforms in order
just to earn a money by endeavouring the data of individuals has to change because that is not only the business model
we still need to face that problem because the communication data needs to be protected in
so we can be very proud as the % european union ] and especially of ` parliament ] we have a tool to protect that
it is about fundamental rights privacy awareness but privacy enforcement as well namely the right to be forgotten enshrined
but it is also about democracy because fake news is a high red war of intoxication many political lies and hates peach aimed to weaken democracy through interfering innovations and inhancing populism and ) european ] so that it takes a response to ) european ] which means that no member
that is what the ) european ] citizens are expecting from all of us and that is precisely and exactly what
the commission must take initiative action and now
reporting this value is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of the % european union ] because the guarantee does need member states fulfill the international law obligations and that they contrast each other and the institutions of the % european
the % european union ] was founded on the principles of respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for

this report also has other important implications for the fundamental rights of minorities roman children women and eduptive people and for those seeking asylum
this was proved in the last couple of years and this must be rectified that is why in this report we call for a new mechanism that is ultimately triggered in case of breaches of fundamental values and rights to remedy the breaches of
no focus will mean that we will be missing some targets
too many mandates and at the same time can lead to fragmentation and to high cross
so we should keep finding the right balance and finding the trade office to be focused and efficient in the work at
through various programmes in exchange of best practices and know how and by ensuring the availability of necessary funding for education training agreements raising and empirement of women as well as for the continuous fight against ingender vulnerably
it is about jobs and it is
i understand that we are involved in a big legal battle of the
it is about ) european ] citizens thrust into ) european ] commission and institutions
just let me give you ! few examples
mr president all other members i have listened carefully to the debate @ today ]
we need to speak vitally quality we need to counteract raise it
i was in the rivals house waiting to go out through customs when we heard and felt the ~ first ]
no right use or surveillance technology in the world can
then the ~ second ] explosion and some of us thought that the roof was coming down upon us
my body remembers that fear and it is in that feeling that i refuse those that say that we have to learn to live with this terrorism is man made
it is the moment to step back for a moment to just pause and think through the implications of our actions and
we are taking the right measures to invest massively into better equipment and better cooperation of our police and security services and into effective derogaticalisation or are we still putting forward expensive and simplific measures of massive and simplific measures against completely innocember
thereby we can in effective security and our freedoms together and
therefore i am very happy that commissioner } king ] is starting to investigate into the effectiveness of the ( hundreds of security ] measures which the % european union ] and its
if this is what you are calling for then we will
however the most offensive position that you have taken is the proposal that spain will have the right to visa any brexit deal over the issue of % gibraltar ]
i do however have a solution to prevent % gibraltar ] being used as a pawn in practice negotiations and indeed end spanish claims wants and for all make % gibraltar ] a fully integrated part of the
i have been calling this @ for many years ] and with the unique opportunities that % brexit ] has given us i believe it is an idea whose time has come

this i guarantee would cause amendments damage to the economies of the % european union ] and good resolve in putting many of your citizens out of work it is what we call in the % uk ] cutting off your nose to spece
i want to make it clear in this chamber today that people of % gibraltar ] are proudly ) british ] in @ two thousand and two ] ! ninety nine ] of ) gibraltarians ] voters in a ) referendum ] against shared
~ first ] our position is our attitude and promoted pro ) europeans ] is very well described in % hamlet ] when % russia ] describes the expression of the father of % hamlet accountance ] more than in anger that will be our attitude in
i will just underline ! four ] ideas that seem to me of the utmost importance of the subject
however it is a step that should not be taken lightly
to me as an mep the effects of climate change to the rights of internal speople are well very close to my heart because warming climate is to direct or indirect cause for many of the violations against their
we need to understand and be aware of that
budget consolidation needs to be complemented by a social investment strategy that will address the social employment in education taxets of the eu two thousand and
i had no answer but it is office refused to respond to
gender diversity on burdens leads to more sustainable decisions and therefore emerges inter ) european ]
i would therefore like to stress again the importance of reaching ~ first ] reading agreement on an issue which is sure important in
% stonia ] has chosen ! four ] main objectives for the @ next
the logical order of these ! four ] objectives seems clear the inclusive and sustainable * europe ] that % stonia ] wants to promote as the ~ fourth ] objective will be closer if the ~ first ] ! three ] objectives
this regalled may certainly firstly date and more inclusively
i am confident and convinced that in the months to come % stonia ] will go in the direction of the nouncing annual bridge of fundamental rights in the
question and development have reached to do so because so far we have not yet restricted ! one ] single substance
that was my question if it is really appropriate and it will be
let me say that such a policy chief would be a strategic blunder the % eu ] should continue to do where
therefore i would say that the recent events in % russia ] and the presidential elections actually present a case for staying decourse in @
) iran ] 's some of its citizens as threats repression happens to real people people with
questioning is basically what is the commission doing to prevent execution of these innocent people who only dream occressing freedom
since the ) iranian ] options are limited and their cash floor is limited and their foreign currencies are not limited they might very well offer as a quippro quo navel basis or air basis for % russian ] or % chinese military ] in the * middle east ] and this is of course bad news very bad news for anyone
as according to the justice pq which we fully support and also as a diplomatic success from the % european union ] i would ask you in the next
i admit that most viables or dependent on who make the decisions in the @ beginning of next year ] in % washington ] but right now at a next couple of months ] we have an expiring weapons and bargo there is no movement from the % us ] aid to be expected and which creates a dohnting challenge we must say to } tright ] to restrain and limit arbs
the alternative means that the financial solution is welcome because basing will sell
the same page
our talks are with * europe ] with bigging in % moscow ] on going can you and
the ) iranian ] foreign minister has welcomed it an eleven days from now like the ) islamic ] revolutionary } gaza ] has said a new faith in military cooperation between % iran ] and the world 's
debates however seem to be concentrating on who ever gets the ticket in the wide house
still hope to limit arms easily
no way then a peaceful solution out of this long conflict international peace needs to be an international end
it is therefore absolutely unacceptable that the countries are turkey for example contributed with mercinaries among other things to worse and the situation even more the % eu ] is a region bill to them
i am glad that the international community is ready to assist any unity to support the ongoing process in
that is what we have had to improve and i really appreciate that you are taking this on your agenda and i would really see that member states are supporting you in making better use of
so @ yes ] in the beginning of this huge transition we will still need for so few and therefore % eu ] policies should support carbon capture and enable government support schemes for blue hide region and i expect the commission to move forward in this
our biggest problem is that the perfection is becoming the enemy
infrastructure in the scale of electrolises but also in carbon capture unilisation and storage because we
well all together that is not a sustainable
luckly there is ! one ] technology we all agree on that has the potential to decarbonise at least our heavy industries and transport hiddren
we have @ thirty years ] to rechape our entire energy system and we can do it and we will fail if we demand to be perfect but we will definitely succeed by doing it as we
and just look at the political debates no new clear energy please no cover capture that untils fossil fuels no bio mass no gas in a transition no wind mills in my back yard and no solar penalty it
how can it possibly be serious in reaching our climate goals without technologies like governing capture by omar }
it might not be a silver bullet but we all agree that this energy carrier has enormous potential and our aim is clear to create a new clean produce green hijarity markets and a long term certainty for all parties involved and that requires maced
if we want to pave the way for clean hide region we initially will be to invest in transitional technologies and these might not be perfected
welcoming criminals into our % european union ] with open arms just because those criminals are rich is totally outrageous and means for feeding that trust because the regardless of what the ) syparian ] or any other governments
to ! one ] % eu ] country passport also means the access to the whole % eu ] with all the benefits that takes years for normal people to enjoy even though they might have been extemplary
this is not having a sincere cooperation nor is it upholding the integrity of what an % eu ] citizenship should mean convicted oligarchs and corrupt business man have nothing to do here all
the ~ second ] is on so why does the treaty include all the countries who have this kind of system in place referring to the infringement
in this respect we welcome on efforts to maintain common safety standards to put in place with other protection measures strict controllers in training in safety procedures as well as for enforcing regular risk assessment and preventing measures by meps
we should not be hypocritical cleaning formally to the letter of the treaty and taking it as a ) christian ] as an excuse to look
hindering the livery of tangible benefits for our citizens and posing problems for those wishing to live work or do business across borders it is time to people at the heart of % eu ] policy making bioding problematic areas dismantling citizens barriers and improving primplematic areas which result in concrete benefits in the daily lives
we are harmong competition they are creating unfair and increasing inequality
maybe most of them are actually legal but they met not only because in views of many people they are immoral they met him
we cannot only read by example but more decisively use soft and hard powers to persuade the others that are making the gay and
some cases do not be afraid to go for harmonisation
since this is the moment when i have to turn to finance ministers because they have
much to be worried about presecution of opposition and journalists and therefore i think the % eu ] has to stand up ~ first ] of the % european ] beliefs and conditions enhance cooperation on convincing progress and
mr president from the recently leaked capables with ! one ] participant stating it is impressive to see how some member states present themselves outwardly as proponents of tax reforms and at the same time to watch in the code of conduct
i actually listen to my constituents and i know they are furious about tax dodging both businesses and individuals
as i said there is no ornor room for complacency and many things have to be
ahead of the meeting as we know some % eu ] leaders voice concerns about external detablising influences on the region and these happen mentioned again > tonight ]
i believe our response has to be ever more visible and strong engagement in the region to support those forces that fight for
the % eu ] is a peaceful project a project that aims to end frequent and bloody warrant between neighbours horrible experiences that the * western bulkins ] know only
the prospects of ) european ] integration from % montinegro ] and the * western balkans ] is therefore essential for peace in the region and across * europe ]
as the commissioner noted montinegro continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to % eu ] integration
its steady progress in opening chapters is it only bringing it closer to % eu ] accession but as many others have said is also providing a positive example for other countries and
my group tables a number of amendments to the report specifically focused on enhancing human rights
i am pleased that many of these are reflected in the reports covering topics from ensuring media freedom to improving working conditions for civil society to better arrangements for victims of gender based violence to eliminating obstacles to healthcare education highesing and employment for roman
i am referring to that because we are at the crossroad
i think the fast track the commission and ` parliament ] is now attributing is an achievement because it is
a ~ second ] issue which is important and on the also achievement for ` parliament ] is we are reflecting that we are living in an ever changing innovation environment it 's new its fast its ambitious its dream by a bis we
but we failed
tackle children 's cancel
we for the ~ first ] time do not fight the fight between several reduction and competitivenesses that we just focus on energy production what we are going to do is yes it is not a contradiction to do severe reduction and we have to do something about that and that is the focus on manufacturing we want to
we have to do something about that leadership and we want to do want to have a continued continued in @ ten years
it is not for sunday speeches it is not for the sake of the ecodemic life and it is about the substance of the well being of that

we do not want to have the ) america ] ~ firstly ]
we have fast enough in the international context
the historic legacy of enlightment is very much related to
we want to ask the world to work together with us
we have not a bottom up approach
we want to have more often ambition but we want to align serious reduction and
i think what is important to understand is that this is not yet another programme but one of the biggest contribution to the ` european economy ] but also to the well being of the ) european ]
i think what we are going to achieve with that programme is first of all we are going big we tackling the big challenges which are related to the ordinary lack
we in terms of technology and we want to
funded
i am in view of the population in * europe ] but the basis of our well being is innovation
by the ` dprk ] on a ! south korean ] ireland
we also expect % china ] to clearly condemn this act
there have been severe casualties among the south car in military and especially under the ( seven population ] of that
we welcome that % barron ] 's action the high representative of the action in a concerned manner with other international actors our allies and our strategic partner the republic of % korea ] in condemning this clear violation of the ) un ] corean amazon agreement
we call upon the ` dprk ] to avoid any further escalation and to undertake all necessary efforts to maintain peace and stability on the )
such prevention preserphoses major commitment as well as sustained and consistent efforts by the commission by national governments of countries experiences such financial society international agencies and others
there are still types against women preventing them to fully enjoy equal treatment in employment and educational opportunities in many
this is harassing but underline positive problem in several countries
i am talking about
but even worse than those billions is frustration and anger when attories and artists and we love them we prove this today a company propriator or a worker a student a patient or a doctor cannot find those necessary information afforded to fill out when the ` hero she and ` council ] problems were delivering documents online this was
we would all like to see jobs back in
we just had a very good discussion on youth unemployment earlier to this discussion and i really think that we have an obligation to look into all possibilities of supporting growth and job creation
in this perspective one might be minor but important thing could be an imploying financial participation in fp
` efp ] can strengthen small and medium sized enterprises offering mechanisms for innovative financing as workers may wish to invest in chairs in their own company by which they are
despite these possible benefits the focus on ` europe ] various from member state to member
this is a reason for me to participate in this very important debate @ today ] because when it comes to imploying share ownership and employing financial participation the commission and ` parliament ] as was mentioned by my colleague from the ` eppo one has been talking
we have done starteds and we have collected information data and knowledge
now i think it is time to
i would like to ask the commissioner a very simple question
are you planning to put forward a proposal for an action plan on this
we have adopted an opinion on employing financial participation we have made several studies we have adopted a resolution we have completed a pilot project and so
i am sure that this was a mistaken
in polance a catching of regional initiative has helped for example to improve their condition for starting the business the management of financial instruments or special planning practices
i understand very well that some of you may sing that we are demanding too much but on the other hand we all know that challenges the
very much welcomes our main finding of these reports
instead of reinstating border checks and undermining one of the % eu ] 's fundamental freedoms we need closer coordination among our security and law enforcement agencies instead of getting ever greater amounts of data and undermines civil debates we need more effective intelligent challex
this is the way in which this is the polish government this polish government
so fairly i thought it was totally right when she explained it
we are all wrong
we have no idea what is happening
they are all wrong and
the problem in % poland ] is that they are trying to change the state and to model it so that generations to come will have no chance
that is the thing that we have to be concerned about because there are ! there millions ] and ! millions ] of poles probably ! half of them ] more than ! half of them ] that would still make up a pretty big member
who wanted about critic
those poles we are standing up for because they have chosen to be part of the ) european ] society there
they send their children to % special ] so called ) european ] school which is completely isolated from the rest
our missages discover your talent
at that time we were focused upon the whole business of the modernisation of the modernisation of competition policy the significant amount of work taken forward by former commissioner } marju monti ] and my current commissioner } nealy crucia ] and looking at the inpact of
we have seen record activity on the part of the commission in terms of dealing with hard coord car tells we have seen the development of the leniency system and we have seen record fines put into operation by the commission and we have seen record activity in terms of murders and
but i mention the change of contacts because of course we all recognise that since the reports were published by the commission the commission 's work in terms of state aid particularly has really taken on a rather different dimension
it is very important and our report says so that in addressing those matters we recognise some of the challenges that there are for an effective market
in the banking sector in the % united kingdom ] at the moment it is one very clear area where there will have to be when economic circumstances become a little carmor a general review of the new architecture that we have got and whether that are cotected
mr president the commission produces its annual competition report and it is traditional for the ` parliament ] to cast its eye over the report and produce an uninitiative reaction to it
that is something similarly that our committee and ` parliament ] has been
in this case because of timing factors the reports for ! two thousand and six ] and ! two thousand and six ] and ! six ] and two thousand and six and seven have been brought together but taking up one of the points mentioned by commissioner } barroso ] at the earlier it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather marketly since in fact we began the exercise of considering
our committee 's drawn attention to ! two ] specific concerns what we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers particularly in relation to food
it is very important that when the commission gives its approval it is giving that approval in ways which are compatible with the treaty and do not create such significant market power in future that that becomes a senorial fact
almost on a daily basis the commission is now looking at the effect of the bailouts that are taking place in the context of the great financial
but enlarge that has been a very good story in these reports and that is very clear from the reaction that we have from ` parliament ]
this is a process that is gathering pays in terms of modernisation because the commission is currently bringing forward proposals in a wide paper on introducing private damages
to me as an mep the effects of climate change to the rights of internal speople are well very close to my heart because warming climate is to direct or indirect cause for many of the violations against their rights
we need to understand and be aware of
incentives during negotiations has to lie in the implementation of the commitments taken by % gapan ] to illiminate non tariff barriers in the areas sector particularly in the @ autumn

we cannot accept that our ! two ] way trade with the world turnoversationality

in this respect i am highly appreciative of commissioner } barnier ] 's strong amendment to take into account a citizen 's concerns and auspirations

this presents massive opportunities for * europe ] and it is now up to us policy makers to make the right choices and create a conducive environment so that * eu ]
& finski ] is often used to refer to a specific scene of start up disrupting finance with innovation
this definition is not the one used in our report because it would exclude a large amount of relevant actors
instead financing finance finance in able by new technologies covering the whole range of financial services products and infrastructure
it also includes intertechnic the use of new technologies in ensurance and rack the application of new technologies for regulatory compliance the current rise of financing comes at the origination of a number of different types bank
namely artificial intelligence cloud computing and disrebuted legitimal technology
these provide new opportunities for disruptions like mulbal payments open banking crowd funding cripped up currencies and robe of advice
financing can lead to significant benefits such as cost reductions efficiency gains and
it can be also an effective tool for financial inclusion opening up high level services for it
furthermore financing can enable cross border financial flows and infrastructure through alternative lending and investment channels

this is not only important for * europe ] 's financial infrastructure but also for the real economy with consumers and businesses benefiting from improved financial services
notwithstanding all the benefits finding also confronts us with essential questions of irregulatory societal nature
consumer protection and the stability of the financial system should be key concerns in this
together with the competitiveness of the ) european ] economy they make for the core priorities of this
the report does not intend to give
however it does intend to pose the right questions
that should be a first step in the process of creating a forward looking ) european ] policy in the area of financial technologies
the intention of this report is not to propose specific legislative actions
we must be cautious with creating new rules because much is still unclear about future developments of financial technologies
the better point of departure is investigating where current legislation causes uncertainties or barriers and identifying where additional action is necessary
doing this purposefully requires a holistic approach as technological development in our digitising society call for breaking cycles
financial actors are already breaking cyberalls
often they offer products in a diverse multiparty conjunction
i have some minutes left at the end i will use the time then
i would like to go on with any kind of digital services we have to have very strong common simple understanding
i very much hope that the cooperation between the commission and ` parliament ] we can make also clear to the ` council ]

in addition with the implementation of a harmonised ) european ] approach making these websites accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable
the directive now covers all % eu ] public sectors bodies websites and websites providing public services as laid down in
this directive is essentially a forerunner in the plant ) european ] accessibility act which i know is also being eagerly awaited
the specifications for the accessibility are technology neutral and based on the international weapon content accessibility
in our increasing the digital world accessibility is very much a human right and all people are entitled to use the internet in all
less than ! one third ] of * europe ] 's public sector and government websites and even as the intent percent of * europe ] 's websites in general are fully accessive
however despite the fact that assistant technology already exists * europe ] has been legging
in * europe ] this amounts to ! eighty million ] citizens with disabilities and another ! eighty seven million ] aged over ( eur sixty five one hundred and sixty seven million ] ) european ] citizens is too great a number to be ignored throughout my envolvement with % istance ] i have seen what these people face went trying to nevigate their way online it was particularly and
we are the % european union ] and we should be setting the agenda not struggling
making websites and their content useable for all should have already become a priority over
this piece of legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited by both citizens with disabilities and our increasing ageing population which finds themselves more and more isolated and excluded from a world where information is accessible primarily online
the incommittee was more ambitious and made a number of significant amendments to the text
i am sure the ) greek ] presidency will follow up the goodwork on this file it is completely feasible that the ) italian ] presidency will be able to bring this dossier into legislation

i completely agree with this principle therefore commissioner i would like to ask you to night if you think that this principle should receive benefits from the country in which the ` european consumer ] has contributed should apply for not only frontier workers

they have the right to freedom of

this is the ongoing smes to the ` member states and the equalities because they would not like to be integrated in hongery and they would like to move on the next day to reach a country so you must have a strategy about the treaty
we are in the position to pledge the ) european ] government more

there are @ two thousand and eleven ] and a report on % iceland ] clearly demonstrates % iceland ] 's advanced level of preparation the closure of @ eight ] negotiationship that is most welcome by the challenging necessary authorities and agriculture and i am in here chapter such as fisheries and agricultures
greater importance should also be given to negotiations on chapters such as original policy the environment and the economic and monetary policy i saw that according to the recent pole the majority of iceland are still opposed % eu ] membership since @ sixty seven ] are against
the legislator defined both manitary information and voluntary information for good consumers making information across your point of the legislation
it is critical that consumers have access to complete information in order to make an informed choice
the resolution of the fisheries committee discusses the commission survey from control of @ two thousand and fifteen ] which analyses the conformity of labelling with the legal requirements of wide fishing retail
however numbers are worrying for some species for which the level of conformity is very low common species are substituted for more expensive
it could help in the creation of an external structure which scrutinises the sertification of voluntary claims including on the label of fishery and aquicultural
i would also like to remind the commission that ` parliament ] is still awaiting the commission report on the possibility to define and establish minimum criteria for the creation of an % eu ] % eu ] equally
further information of fish can be added to a label as an addition to compulsory information
member states must implement sanctions which are efficient proportionate and
compulsory and correct information must be available for consumers all the way through the chain including dinors and restrance
it deals with voluntary information on fishery products and aims at creating and up to date and exhaustive informatory of voluntary claims associated with the fishery and equicalture products which are marketing in the % european union ] whatever
the commission is currently working on the implementation of a pilot project proposed by the ` parliament ] @ last year ] and my regards to our chair vis } de gadequa ] could not be here
this inventory will enable an analysis of the certification systems of these claims
it is also necessary that such information be reliable meaning it must be controlled in a very strict manner
this information can able consumers to have complementary information such as data of catch data of landing more information of fishing gear the flagstate information on the naturitional value of the product environmental ethical or social information
in a separate study from @ last year on labelling investment ] in % brussels ] including the % eu ] cantinents the & end of ocean ] estimates mr } labelling ] at ~ thirty two ] of all with a mislabelling rate in blue fintuna to be ! eighty ] of the existing law
~ first ] and foremost member states have to reinforce controls in order to identify fraud and the missing links in the supply chain for fisheries and agriculture products which lead to mislabelling or
it is the duty of member states to guarantee that this information is available and accurate
we are waiting this external structure and hope that this information will be easily
the publication of this report is a requirement of the common market organisation for fishery and aquiculture regulation
this is often the case for blue fina
compulsory information is the following commercial designation of species and its scientific name the production method and fishing here the area where the product was caught or produced and the clear indication where the product was defrosted this mandatory information applies both to retail and supply for cators
restrance must always keep the information which they received when they both the product in case consumers or state authorities ask for
i think we need to promote public awareness and unline safety especially among children but also with parents so that they know exactly what is going on what can be done
it is a wonderful source of information for all of us and it is something that is going to be part of our lives into the future however there are those who pray on children and they will use the international and as much as they possibly can to try and
i think member states should work together to introduce a network of contact points for the public to reach a report illegal and powerful content and
if i could turn to activity based budgetary and management i in the commission has made huge progress on this but i would warn against overprographising this exercise because what we want to ensure is a quality tickling boxes
it will allow us to get a much clearer idea of our policy perspectives on top of the commission 's annual
mr president out of this budget review we simply after ask ourselves ! one ] question does the budget reflect the political priorities of the @ twenty five century ] if it does not in each
is it flexible enough to reflect changing times
we do not want people spending all their time invaluating themselves when they should be getting on and doing
we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the * amf ]
now it is about university it is about angels it is about the next national consultation
we have witnessed an attempt attempt a vague idea to reintroduce the death penalty and all that comes from a man who is constantly referring to ) christians ]
the only thing that comes to mind to me in all this context is if all foreign influences so bad why do you accept the payment of ( eur five billion ] annually as the big natural sepaent of ) european ] structural funds in order to plastic all
somebody who does that for a minister leave the % union ] out of their
we have witnessed several unspeakably worded national consultatings
the annual think for a minister is not about transparency as we all know it is in order to leab those who are foreign funded as foreign because they might carry foreign influences to hungry and foreign influences

it is also a moment of truth for our policy in the eastern neighbourhood and i would like to the biggest steps there of the % eu ] spare foremonts as a geopolitical actor capable of defending its interests and values in all
i fully share the ` parliament ] 's sense of urgency to make progress on this proposal
i therefore welcome the proposal of the budget committee of the ` european parliament ] which proposes to restore most of the appropriations proposed by the commission in
@ two thousand and fifteen ] we cannot afford the % eu ] budget being paralised we need to bring it under control we
i fully agree that we must act responsibly and address at this stage the needs that we
however even if indeed further reinforcement contribute to increasing investments we should try and find the right balance with the implementation prospects and the payments of
we should seize such opportunity to address the shortage of payments and
all this has to be achieved within very time financial circumstances and
we must also honour our obligations and pay offending bills teaming from past commitments thus avoiding unnecessary burden on beneficiaries
sustainable economic growth competitiveness the creation of jobs and the fight against youth unemployment are over arching priorities of the % eu ] policy and should be reflected in the orientation of the & eu ] expenditure for @ two thousand and fifteen ] we must do this under a clear and agreed framework and provide a necessary predictability for
must put all our efforts in making this framework for the operational for the respecting of the terms of this agreement
@ fifteen ] @ last month ] i expressed before this house the commission concerned about the position taken by the ` council ] in its reading of the budget
an exceptional additional revenue from financing from the enforcement of the competition policy means that the additional payment request for @ two thousand and fourteen ] will be into no cost for member
the level of payment appropriations remains the permanent concern that we need to address at this positive consolidation we must ensure that the legal obligations arising @
we must avoid our deficient under budgeting in the future as we are now aware of the problems that such an approach brings
the reinforcement of payment appropriations proposed by the commission in @ amending eleberate letter one ] goes in the same direction as a number of amendments proposed by the ` european parliament ] where the needs are most pressing and in particular with the aim of reducing the backlock of anti debates
in its draft budget the commission has proposed to use the full amount of payment appropriations under the & amff silving for
as you know favourable developments on the revenue side in @ two thousand and fourteen ] we
i have in mind for example the % eu ] governance of mayors which has been contributed to our climate and energy objectives
this is indeed where regions and cities should be when it comes to finding solutions for climate change mitigation and adoptation they have proved to be ambitious for our looking
there will be no place for business as usual
i think it is very importan
adoption is a wonderful alternative for otherwise one wanted children or a child that 's left in an unsafe environment
but what concerns me about this report is that it is another power grab vibrants over the jurisdiction of family law
in the % uk ] there are strict laws about family courts including the privacy of proceedings for what is and always will be a very emotive subject
but what i fear with this latest demand for more * europe ] is the best interest of the child may be put second to the % eu ] 's desire for
and what happens if it is a dispute to adoption
if the grand parents want to adopt
or ! one ] parent is actually fighting the
how will that work if the child is taken across another country 's border another culture or maybe where the child will be brought up speaking a different language
i believe that we all should be encouraging families to be strong and cohesive units which is the best environmence
much more importantly disagree with that just witness the political maddling in the & brexit ] process or a number of ) european ] general elections so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider and this is not an issue for natory 's influence
the report makes reference and emphasises rightly and the security defends and political challenge that % russia ] provides for the % european
much as i would like to avoid this we cannot simply support this fight as it stands now

high government officials suspected of being implicated also in the same operations and police authorities refusing to investigate those allegations because they have been appointed by and have economic and personal disease with the gone

but i cannot answer all of them but i have tried to bring them back to
this is also my answer to mr } bashir ] on this issue better guarding our borders and working on better return mechanisms
but i also also eagerly await the ) italian ] government 's national measures because they have to do a lot to better manage the influence of illegal markets and then they know that they stand ready to show solidarity and also as a % european union ] to work collectively

we also have to remain focused and this is crucial on structural

this is not sustainable
and let me put a final question do you really believe that ! one ] of burden of burden of ( one ] of the gdp is the fast track the beak way for the big government of ) european ]
please be reasonable

in our position not an agreement within the legal meaning of the treaty

it is fully clear that they have a right to be heard they have a right to be here

we are also combining it with getting more of a grip on who is coming to the ) european ] member

in my opinion the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control services requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out a maximum
the review will also increase the effectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of the customs administrations due to the joint automatic implementation system that will assist in preventing investigating

~ secondly ] we believe that before committing large amounts of fresh money to the defence and security we should explore the full potential of efficiency gains through cooperation and only after this shall be considered additional funding that might be available for
these are the main reasons why our group is unable to support the report even though we are committed to a stronger ) european ] common defence in security policy and there are many very good ideas in the report of

ahead of voting on the legislation of the food we should recall the reasons for having been prudent and the ware of risks for health and wealth for events
we know from our past experience with the similar issues that tackle both food safety and ethical relations between humans as dominant species and nature that public perception depends very much on the specific known
consumers are increasingly sensitive about suffering and injuring of farm animals and therefore they have right to be informed about the potential of cloaning to cause pain and to ensual
yet the development of animal clawning as a matter of food production is being pursued without public awareness
the problem which cloaning does not concern just welfare of animals but also consumer confidence in food since it is believed that in * europe ] food is produced to a very high standard
the euro barrometer study from % last actober ] documented serious public concerns in regard to capability of future use of food products from clones this is linked to the sale of important food which could be eventually sold in * europe ]
i therefore agree with rapporteurs approach urgent the commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clothes

we have changed fundamentally and we need institutions that reflect global economy in the way it operates and deals with
we are domestic competition
mr president i think that we have got to realise the spite of the different political views in this ` parliament ] is that global cooperation not just in banking institutions but global cooperation in other areas and physical and monetary policy and for trade have got to be
there are global problems that need global solutions
more manufacturing is being done in * asia ] than in *

we found that banks that we thought were independent were completely entangled with other banks in different countries and we have to deal with
for us to sit apart to be a loof and not to cooperate with other countries is a recipe for failure and for an inability to solve a problem that is actually a global banking failure that is spread across the

i think it comes out from this discussion for it for me is it to have global solutions to global problems we will also not just need our ) european ] institutions to be strong but
more than a children dollars has been spent in recapitalising banks across the
that will require us to shape global institutions and my message to this ` parliament ] is
i have asked whether the world bank and other international institutions can help can
there is trade around the world at a speed that we have never seen before until this crisis and have got to do

we have had several rounds of discussion in attempting to find a solution
to find ! one ] flexibility needs to be shown by everyone and i will repeat it by each
