mr president i thank you } martin ] president and ~ first ] of all i would like to thank on the members who are ratisiative inditions put on debate for
i look forward to continuing to work with you on their foresharing proposal and bringing it to a successful conclusion with your support
we all agree in the last session in strasbogue that development is important but we need to remember it now when we are talking about the financial contributions
we need to invest intro neighbours of development and yes most of all we need to invest in good governance
they are ready to give ! thousand and fewer ] to traffickers because there is not good governance
migrants are not even extremely poor but they are all extremely desperate
if we get back for example to the issue of migration we will see that this is the key question of governance
forward to war but also the lack of freedom and bad governance is what makes desperate people to undertake dangerous journeys in the search for a better life in * europe ] and development cooperation is part of the answer to this challenge
in all these efforts ahead of the ~ third ] international conference in % al aberba ] we need to be aware of the fact that finance alone will not be sufficient policies are of fundamental importance in achieving sustainable development goals we need policies that will bring to further mobilisation of resources unsustainable development
furthermore we need the completely new approach to financing development
this is a ~ first ] regulative act which will provide police in all member states with their commercials
i suppose and i am sure that it is not the end of discussion is not beginning the discussion because it is really very complicated package and i do not think that all of how members are ready for package
we have to be ready for that
it does not mean that we have to be technologically ahead of technology we have to be very firm and argue principle ground it is the fundamental rights of people to be people people people people first at technology for people
! ninety ] econology is ahead of us
was ! one ] of the regions that brought us to the financial crisis
we do more and could you perhaps be more specific what has been done so far and what are you in
mr president i also want to raise the issue of religious freedom of for all without discrimination because this is ambasing
efsi also concludes to the accoupt ! twenty one ] objectives to instandable development and environmental objectives in mind efsi also increases the local presence level through the reinforcing of the ) european investment basis ] at
we all know that some member states will do their best to weaken this legislation
we took many measures to improve the situation and i believe we reach their certain improvement
with climate change bringing more extreme ways or events we need to be able to protect human lifes and valuable assets and make our regions our cities and our tarms more resilient
as for energy @ three years ago ] % eu ] had sure government decided to set the current * two thousand and fourteen ] as a clear deadline for the completion of internal energy market
well orders on tax the commission action plans have been published and adopted
it also says clearly that it urgests the member states which are absent here not to impose any obligation on incryption providers that would result in the weakening or composing of the security of the networks or devices such as the creator a creation of facilitation of backdoors
for the % eu ] the immediate challenge is to help ensure a fair and increasive electoral process and be prepared for a rench of senarious
but we should not lose sight of the big picture
the ) irish ] system works within a legal and regulatory policy directive framework dictated by the % eu ]
% ireland ] is no worse or no better than any other place but i object to hostile commons about % ireland ] eminating from % london new york ] and the ) german ] media
all these places have experienced regularly and banking challenges and problems equal to and in many cases far worse than what we have faced in % ireland ]
the ` constant ] snipping from some of our % eu ] neighbours has been based on prejudice rather than objective fact and those little for the % eu ] solidarity at a time when * europe ] is going through enormous financial and economic challenges
thank you very much for the ) greece ]
raising funds for research and care addressing discrimination at work and advocating for policy change we decision make us all depend on previous awareness and understanding of multiplescarosus
our choice tomorrow is to go for a strong mandate with a bun and go for negotiations or go for negotiations using as a starting point on mandate and end up with something meaningless
in exchange we go the protection of the vulnerable marine cosystems
mr president @ one month ] after we voted our compromise the ` council ] put it on the agenda did not even present it i would use this time to talk with the member states and the presidency
if this compromises further what a done it will become meaningless
if you want to change the rules in ` parliament ] of ` parliament ] of the ` balance of the countries ] you have to change it ~ first ] in the ` council ] and then we will see finally as you say i fully understand the position of the ` council ] in the & specient candidate ] issue but they also have to approve
the ` county rate ] we have to approve its programme and we have to approve the college
finally you have been in the % us ] @ last week ] i hope you have interesting meetings
we new have a date to give us today on the shopping and interest case
in this report we strongly support the independence of the commission and the national competition authorities
what with commissioner } amonia ] was with commissioner } amonia ] in
as you know this is a non binding report but it sends a strong political message to the commission
@ two thousand and thirteen ] this may be the last competition report of this term @ next year ] we have ) european ] elections again
yet the importance of our ` partnership ] with the ` eib ] and with the % european union ] in meeting our commitments both to our sharehooders and to our countries of operations is clearer than ever
~ secondly ] under the agas of the % european union ] new structures of cooperation between ` eib ] and ` eib ] offer great new opportunities for us to work together
these initiatives facilitated by ecb funds bring us together to work concretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and such offer an excellent crucible in which to forge the development of our joint work
we have this wide range of stakeholders we are working together to implement the plan and are developing the coordination and cooperation mechanisms to do so and we see as we saw last orgast driven banking crisis in % jodia ]
~ third ] i take the ` european parliament ] 's views as welcome input to the early stages of the ` ebrd ] forthcapital resources review which we will conclude at our annual meeting in % zabrab ] and % may ]
faced with the dramatic decline and private flows of credit we came together @ last month ] with the ` world bank group ] to launch the joined irify action plan and support of banking systems and lending to the real economy in central and eastern * europe ]
an increase of more than ! two ]
~ first ] the context of the financial and economic crisis renders any encouragement of greater cooperation between ` eib ] and ` eib ] more relevant than ever
at the same time we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is also increasing
@ two thousand and ten ] the ` ebrd ] has taken a pro active stand in response to the crisis supporting our clients and countries of operations we are expanding our instruments and aiming to invest ! seven billion ] to invest ! seven billion ]
yet the crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy driven respiration but a vital necessity
the full implications of the current situation on our potfolio and on the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen
i believe it is in this context that we may find devisions of labour applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation including common standards which you have called for
that this kind of our view cooperation born of need is the kind that we expressed
i refer in particular to the * western balkans ] investment framework now being launched as well as choose ` eastern partnership ] announced by the ` european council ] in @ recent days ] which will build on the good cooperation we have already established through our memorandum of understanding and the neighbourhood investment facility
the action plan recognises that an effective crisis response and * europe ] 's integrated financial markets requires fast and coordinated action by all stakeholders parent banks which own a large part of the region 's financial sectors
mr president what worries me most is the suggestion that the ` european investment bank ] has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis that it can somehow act as the europe wide body to provide stimulars where member states are singularly failed to coordinate their own stimulate
i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks
the ` eib ] has a liverage of about ! thirty five ] times and its sharehold as a member state government
if it were to go bust like some of our commercial banks the report even encourages the ` eib ] and the commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments
the danger is that if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments as has been suggested that its enviable high credit rate may be down graded like some of our governments
however i would stress that the commission has neither the capacity nor the desire to lead the delivery of the action plan itself
the implementation of the action plan will require real cooperation commitment and leadership from member states and regional stateholders to the leader the atta or so projects included at this stage
this rapid progress is important if we are to maintain momentum as we answer the implementation face of the strategy
this is the only way to ensure that the ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the member states and other stateholders
the commission very much expects ` parliament ] to be actively involved in events such as the annual forum
the ~ first ] formal assessment of progress made will be presented under the police presidency in the @ second half of two ]
this will give all stakeholders an opportunity to consider how the ~ first ] months of the strategy have gone and what lessons might be drawn already at that stage
that coordination monitoring and recording is done by the commission and the implementation on the ground is led by the member states or the organisations of the ` bultic syrian ]
i would now like to say a few words about the plan governance a system which is proposed for the operational implementation of the strategy
this is ! one ] area wherever there has been much discussion among the member states but the overall approach is that the policy orientations will be taken by the ` council ]
the ` bultic systrategy ] has equired a completely new approach for the ` european commission ] as it is the ~ first ] time that we have prepared an integrated strategy for a group of member states who have to face the same chillenges and who may benefit from the same opportunities
in financial terms although there is no editional financing from the % eu ] budget the strategy proposes a more coordinated use of existing funds and the more imaginative approach to other funding sources such as the ` european investment bank ] or the % northern investment bank ]
of course it is not a complete surprise to me that the ` parliament ] is taking such an interest in the strategy
@ two thousand and eleven ] however prior to that the ~ first ] annual form of the political strategy will take place @ next year ]
i would like to conclude by saying that i look forward to continuing to work closely with the ` european parliament ] on all objects of the strategy
the ) swedish ] presidency has led positive and constructive discussions in ` council ] which are to lead to conclusions already in @ october ]
here we expect to see a wave of coordination meetings to kickstart the various priority areas and individual projects included in the action plan
responsibility must rest with the relevant member states and other stateholders directly involved on the ground
your begging is crucial to maintain wayspread visibility for vestrategy to maintain highless level political support for strategy and to maintain pressure on the member states and the regional actors to deliver results
in addition the commission proposes to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties
i would like to underline this point as it must be clear that all our preparatory work on the strategic framework that i have just escribed we count for not unless we start to deliver genuine visible concrete results on the ground hence the importance of a strategic action plan which has also been drawn up during the preparatory work
the population of * europe ]
the majority are fed up with mess migration they do not want any more migrants and they want to send back those who are now here
we are on ! one ] side and on the other side there is the whole corruptor political alite the thing is the majority of the citizens of * europe ] cannot really speak up because they are punished they are all these has speech laws that silence people is really strange that we are the one
we do have freedom of speech and we speak up for the majority of the citizens of * europe ] but they should also speak up and they should support hongery in our efforts
mr president could i say that the commissioner showed a good understanding of the construction industry
i would emphasise the need for more sea marking absolutely essential we do not want to see any more national standards and i wish this whole process every success for the future
all i would say is that i think it is a larger percentage of the overall ` g p something like twelve thirteen ] of @ per cent ] and materials say ! four ] or ! five ] or ! sector ] it is a very important sector i am a civil engineer by background and it was a privilege to do the opinion on behalf of the industry
a very important measure in a very important industry
the construction industry does need a regulation after @ twenty years ] of having the directive in place
it is evident that gender equality must be main streamed in all policy responses to the crisis in all education and training policies in the european social fund and in other programmes social integration through employment
i having mind a council with a wider mandate covering all economic social environmental and human development in the world
now we should do the same in the % european union ]
i think that we should pay a lot of attention to development issues also in that report
for me personally the most important achievements in this report are the recommendations on the substantial strengthening of the economic social environmental and development dimensions of the % un ] system
by developing it into a sustainable development colonies
my report includes several proposals for strengthening the role of the % united nations ] system in global governance and for improving the possibilities of the % european union ] and its member states to better achieve our foreign policy goals inside the system
these ideas got the lot of support in the negotiations but not enough in order to be accepted
i proposed that the ` council ] would have permanent members the % european union ] % us aid japan ] and the ) brixk ] countries and rotating once
according to the report this must be done in the ~ first ] instance by means of structural and factional reform of the economic and social council but we also call on the % eu ] institutions and consider the possibility of strengthening their role in the ecoson
mr president } council ] } america ] proposed in a speech to the world economic ` council ] in @ double ] in @ two thousand and nine ] the creation of a % un economic council ] according to the model of the ` un security council ]
in the negotiations on my % eu ] % eu ] and report i failed that those who emphasise the importance of security dimension and other % united nations ] were reluctant to strengthen the other parts of the % un ] system
we do appreciate the own resources although we would have wanted to have more ambitious own resources
we have made an agreement in the framework of the % united nations ] and it is called sdgs and in your introduction with the commissioner either } uk ] or younger mentioned the stgs and i think it is so extremely important that we use these potents to make sure that all the money that we spend in all these sectors are used to come up with good results on the sustainable development
all extentions of the case is no longer just added to the issue or political women
it is now a matter of human completion
we should be immediately in that conditional release on humanitarian agreements
to protect the smes and to minimise the localists and regulation offers an exemption for the smallest importance based on the threshold system designed to cover at least ! ninety five ] of all imports to the % european union ]
all industry initiatives have to fully comply with the international oecd deba deligence guidelines elaborated to help companies respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict financing
the ) vicious circle ] has now been broken
stability in * africa ] and in all other conflict areas means less migration flows to the % european union ]
educating stakeholders and achieving long term sustainable effects is only possible by an approach based on shared responsibility
we just have to implement this regulation
we believe that legal trade is good and that trade is meant to sustain jobs and late prosperity for people and for communities
there is ! one ] thing we can do immediately distinguished colleagues and tomorrow we can shoulder the domination of the ` european parliament ] to ensure clean and sustainable minor supply chain
we have hammered out an effective and workable regulation now let us show everybody that we are determined to make this ~ first ] step
i received almost ( one million ] of refugees from neighbouring countries
to low international investigation on the kinnings of protestors on government 's ponsored land cramps
and to provide underestricted access for ) un ] rights organisations and ngos to all parts of the country
our resolution lists ! several ] names ) journalists ] ! one ] line activists who are kept in detention
in a pilot already in
it is the way of acting
@ next year ] we go to the citizens
so we want to hear clearly what the commission is willing
we talk in this house about performance based burchading
@ two thousand and twenty three ] where can i explain to my voters that * europe ] delivers that * europe ] have a better regulation that * european ] and and delivers where companies end schools end
so this is the question break your committee what is to bring forward and i hope that you can come over with it at least a clear message because it was so silent it was too silent
~ second ] depending on this outcome of any of ) church ] anticipated performance review is the commission willing to release the performance reserves earlier
we have our elections and we made our negatiations in the @ year two thousand and thirteen ] in
@ two thousand and seventy ] @ two thousand and eighty eighteen ] there we stand and i will have to wait to thousand and nineteen to have an evaluation and then this morning that is already in the member states can be committed to be spent later in
we have to speak
in this context i support the idea of drawing letting ) america ] and * africa ] more deeply into the existing transatlantic dialogue colleagues it is sometimes said that the % eu ] faces the choice between tightening our strategic partnership with the % us ] or working toward more flexible
but it is a false choice
at the ` european council ] do its part of the job
we ~ first ] have % ireland ] a veteran forty five years in the % european union ] but now we have creation the newest accession
many of us here are convinced that the % european union ] has been in a protracted crisis strugging its feed and hounted by nationalism populism and * eurofolves ] and you know what
it is about the lack of vision to face with the ) european ] fashion the ) eurozone ] needs globalisation and most notably referee to crisis
this is completely different
@ two thousand and twenty ] will the experience of @ two thousand and fourteen ] to ! two thousand and sixteen ] be repeated
this renewed policy definitively leads to more local and ) european ] air value
and glarifying the effects of the late start for the @ next year ] 's emphasis @ three ] will lead to a performance repayment in the years and until
the ex ante conditionality should formulate it leaded to more integrated policy and a better structured and targeted results
you are something you in this house
we need a new payment plan until
we see commitments in the ) social field ] especially for younger people to bringing to a job
@ two thousand and twenty three ] i ask you to include ! three ] respects in this cohesion masterplan taking away the hindrances in the expenditure of the member states
member states were still working on to finalise their programmes and came with a very late agreed programmes for the new period
to practical reflection and the relation of ) european ] semester is established cohesion concerns with ! three ] forth of the country specific recommendations and we made a performance framework there is an example as i said for this
this house will agree on a retalution
in the resolution is the clear request we are now doubt and you could hear it @ todate ] also that you want to have her massed the plan on her cilleration and this is not a theoritical thing
this means that you look and tell us honestly what does it mean if you start @ three years later ]
yes thank you mr president is just to say that i thought my name would be all known the signatures on this
@ sixteen ] the ` council ] protects and supports the budget for instruments that spear growth and thereby create jobs namely such instruments as the efsi cosmer are as much plastic and other
concerning subheding ! van bie ] economic social and territorial cohesion which is another core policy of the % european union ] for the creation growth of growth and jobs the ` council ] proposes limited reductions of payment appropriations on new programmes of ! one hundred and ninety ninety ninety ninety ninety ninety ] european % european union ]
@ two thousand and sixteen ] the ` council ] has accepted in full all appropriations destined to programmes and agencies dealing with the crisis including the use of the flexibility instrument for an amount of farmerly than ! eur thirty million ] of further
frankly the ` council ] and the member states are very concerned to note that all institutions will achieve that go therefore the ` council ] has made it very clear in a statement that it expects that all efforts are deployed to avoid any additional delays in implementing this jointly agreed reduction target
this means that we wish to finance ediquately investments to spare growth and jobs for example through the european fund for strategic investments and to provide sufficient funding to tackle the steel ongoing migration crisis and related external policies
so you can see that the ` council ] stands fully behind the ` european ] gender on migration as was agreed between us in
@ two thousand and sixteen ] programmes and instruments that are related to the migration crisis and the facility for refugees in % turkey ] were not affected by reductions
that bedlock should be fully absorbed by the end of this year in accordance with the ` payment plan ]
global * europe ] the ` council ] undertook a thorough analysis in order to identify space for creating the necessary margin since the commission 's proposal for @ two thousand and seventeen ] has completely exhausted the margin for commitment
i would like to begin by stating clearly that the main trust of the ` council ] 's position is the prioritisation of expenditure
in conclusion as you can see in an effort to find the right balance between on the ! one hand ] a sustainable budget in times of budgetary constraints the drain throughout * europe ] and on the other hand financing a share essential political priorities financing a sential political priorities and necessary
in those areas that cannot be qualified as top political priorities in the current circumstances reductions in the proposal of the commissioner replied in order not to harm programmes the perform well and are coming up to speed
subhering ! van eib ] however has also contributed to the general saving saving set fort concerning some budget lines where the ` council ] considers following a detailed technical analysis that the commission has overestimated the real needs
i think discussion show that we may have some different views but in general we are united by the fact that we want to have a workable budget a good budget for ) european ] citizens
for this on @ seventeen ] and we want to keep the main focus of these discussions on @ two thousand and seventeen ] budget
* european ] surviving global economy only as a competitive economy
if i may just very briefly to some of the important points which were made during the discussion
looking forward to our cooperation
madam president it should change as we have is that we have too many priorities and too little money and the question is how we use the money in the best possible way
all the people have to feel our assistance
we have to stop all supplies of military equipments to the undemocratic governments in the region
of course we have to be ready careful enough to support the forces and movements miss } islamist ] ideology
we have to have a united * european ] positions
on @ ten op september two thousand and nine ] @ last week ] the commission adopted the communication on stepping up international climate finance which aims at speeding up the international negotiations
in this respect it is worth mentioning the global partnership point technology which aims are doubling investment in low curbon technologies
with ! two hundred and twenty fifty ] pages of negotiating tax on the table the negotiations we have not yet gathered sufficient momentum to come to an agreement that is ambitious and detailed enough
however among most parties there is a sense of fedezity and the greelingness to focus on areas of convergence
money will make or break the deal we need to mobilise private investment and promote the establishment of a robust international carbon market but substantial public funding will also be required
furthermore we have to strengthen support to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the increasing adverse effects of climate aims
there is a danting task i heard to fight with the intense negotiations over @ the coming months ] but failure is not an option
we need comparable and more ambitious emission reduction targets for the group of developed cantise which in agriculture @ today ] offer less than ! fifteen ] of centre reduction as comparatory
it is not only that it is also the other carset as we have been cheating and the differences in the different member states like some of them are mandatory the others are voluntary some are only on the national carmon carmat carmarket and others are different
how will you do that
we also have to look to the future and yes we have to care about our car industry but a new era is coming it will be electrified it will be sharing mobility and if we do not make sure that we do that for our industry that we do not make sure that we do not make sure that we have a zero emission mandate
! three million ] carts have not been recalled yet
how should the commission make sure that all consumers in * europe ] have the same right
i actually restrict the access to the % eu ] market afford them which could be a consequence of such extensive regulations
a regulation could really harm the economies of developing war and could actually cause jobs there
! ten ] weeks ago stabilisation and association agreement entered into force
! one ] particular development is that reducing corruption and organised crime and making judiciary more efficient has been assessed as good by the commission
a lot has already been said about the magnitude of this right 's violation and about the relevance of the topic trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed with the human rights faced and victim centred approach
victims and vulnerable populations need to be put at the centre of all efforts
the prevention of trafficking in human beings and the protection of its victims must be our priority goal
exses to chastice support measures shelter and education need to be ensured independent of the victims willingness to cooperate in criminal proceedings
the principle of non criminalisation in this regard is also vital and needs to be implemented in all member states
further demand needs to be tackled as it can be considered a root cause
accountability needs to be ensured for both offenders as well as knowing users
for the new strategy i think that financial investigations and action against money laundering need to play a bigger part in fighting trafficking in human beings and to ensure that confiscated essets are used to support and compensate victims of trafficking
does the commission agree on this and how does it intend to address this in the new strategy
i am vorried about the trent of trafficking in human beings being mixed up with other legally distinct concepts such as migrant smuggling increasingly addressing trafficking in human beings through a security length for instance in the context of recent migration policies
how will the commission counter this strength in its new strategy
i also call for greater internal external coherence in the fight against trafficking in human beings and to further inhense and deepen cooperation coordination among all relevant actions
that would give the enlargement a more prominent present supplementing the usual progress reports for the countries
therefore i sincerely welcome the commission 's strategy and the action plan as documents which will officially and permanently put a vestment border on the ) european ] agenda
it became also clear that we simply cannot wait for all major political issues to be settled before we endevour further elargement
or this could provide a strong political better drop for the difficult work that evades on all sides in order to welcome the frontrunner countries % sarbia ] and % multinageous four members ] in
additionally i would call the commission to draw up annual reports concerning the implementation of this strategy and the action plan which should be discussed here in the plenary
it is important not just for the countries of the region but also for the % european union ] itself because without providing a credible perspective for full membership for all the countries of the * western balkans ] the % eu ] global role will not be credible because this is our region this is our ~ first ] commitment
we need to invest more both politically and financially yes it is a difficult process because enlargement is a common effort
at the same time there is always an alternative we should not forget and the alternative is embracing nationalism and populism and creating rival rise and hostilities again
when there is a will there is always a way and @ last year ] the republic of % messadonia ] made transprogress back to words progress and ) european ] perspective
the public violence the hate speech against a libital people in % egypt ] is rampantly increasing and we are report on that
we are passing on the message mr } commissioner ] is just not enough you do not pass the message about human rights you demand human rights to be respected
i different kind of partnerships
but @ today ] i wanted to raise a specific situation of edubity ipersons being persecuted
it is also a question of when the authorities do this kind of violence
we are really for more complete cooperation in this field and the budget is are given as a portunity to explore new forms of common engagement
these were the ~ first ] association council with ` egypt ] in @ seven years ] so the ~ first ] is the beginning of the revolves in their war
mr president the ` sya ] group recognises the practical value of regional development funding and supports efforts to ensure it spent more efficiently this ! six ] report clearly caused for more to be done there it is not a clean bill of health
i and others in the group are not wholely convinced that there is as full an understanding as there should be that this funding is not a revenue substitute nor is it intended to be for more than a third of the century as has been the case
furthermore i do not believe that part of the agenda behind the in other respects unobjectionable urban policy is desirable either especially and i quote to improve the democratic legitimacy of the ) european ] project
best practice and cooperation yes
i welcome those elements
the chairman decontral free or checkfree travel in the fronteers of the * schengen area ] is a basic principle in ! one ] of the greatest achievements in the % european union ] or though recent tragic events indeed % butchengen ]
the ) third ] documents are chacked on the official checkpoints why not all other ) european ] citizens have to undergo such monitoring
we must do or best in order to provide security for everyone under cogramme circumstances such discrimination and unjustified valuation of the * schengen agreement ] is both unacceptable and unreasonable
this is exactly the aim of the % european year of citizens two thousand and thirteen ] to mark the @ two thousand and thirteen ] of the establishment of the % union ] citizenship by the treaty of message and to give a numan citizenship
as members of the ` european parliament ] the only directly elected % eu ] institution we have a crucial round to play in promoting the aims of the european year of citizens @ two thousand and thirteen ] by bridging the gap between brassels and member states communicating rights and benefits of the ) eu ] citizens
to enjoy protection by the diplomatic or consoner authorities of any member state in a ~ third ] country
all % eu ] citizens must be informed and enjoy without discrimination all rights granted to them by the % union ] law and the chapter of animental rights i
in view of the forthcoming ) european ] elections we must raise our wareness on the legislative powers of the ` european parliament ] and encourage citizens to vote so that their voice is heart clear by human decision makes
to address the institutions of the % union ] to enjoy free movement of goods and services consumer protection public health equal opportunities equal treatment access to employment and to social protection to enjoy the new right of the % european citizens ] initiative
at times of economic political and social crisis only @ twenty months ] before the next ) european ] elections putting union cibizenship and participative democracy at the centre of the political agenda is absolutely essential
to petition the ` european parliament ]
we need to support ` yazo ] in order that people arriving and heaving recylum application properly proceed
the ~ second ] point is we have to change the norman clature of the medi budget lines because putting integration in the return together on ! one ] budget line just abointing being clear on what the money is being spared
but of course we have some questions on details it is our matters of tremendous political importance that we need to debate
i ask why * europe ] while * europe ] should receive the same increase in funding and staff as ` easa ]
you had a very energy efficient airplay and then it could fly on solar
development was lifted on an equal fooding with diplomacy and defence
we have to fight against polity and promote economically and socially sustainable development all over the world
in development policy we have to act in close cooperation with the % united states ] since in this field our basic values growth and interests are very close to each other
this is how we can most effectively tackle also the root causes of our recent security and migration challenges
saying a firm no to eff gm for me or so means that we have touched protective laws and we have to provide strong support to the gross roots organisations that work on this
it is a simple three deprint that i think every woman should be in proud possession of because knowing your body is also a way to take back control to take back power
@ today ] we see their tax on women 's bodies from the likes of tramps with his awful gagrule that wants to threaten women 's exual and reproductive health and rights worldwide
we say no to all forms of patriarch control over our bodies and we say jist to sexual freedom and choice for women and for proper sexuality indication where we can learn about our rights and our women 's rights and our bodies and about kitherists
it has nothing to do with religion but it has all to do with religion but it has all to do with religion but it
these struggles are linked
many people do not even know what it looks like and the dictionaries in @ two thousand and seventeen ] still get it wrong
it is also systematic for me that the key terrorists almost everywhere has been systematically neglected and araised
mr } jm ] support grass with organisations
as colleagues have said ! one hundred and thirty two hundred and forty million ] women and girls have been victims of fgm if gm is older than ) christianity ] or % islam ]
if we are jm activists that fight against efsi but it gives us the power to protect it
colleagues commission our message must be here
but say no tough and also demands that we say no to all forms of hyterical control of our bodies
in @ past year ] all our attention of us focused towards the lowering of care to emissions and particular matters without devoting enough attention to an ox
with the new proposal we are introducing new real driving emissions tests that are closest to the real word use and we will also introduce new type approval legislation that will help these are caused to become much cleaner but we do not need new agencies for that
we should use this period to prepare new developed man plans focusing on new innovative technologies in order to safeguards * europe ] 's position of being the number one car maker in the world
we need stronger rules that will effectively deal with the ommission problems for these all cars
for the upcoming years the classical technologies based on forcing use and the authority solutions will be present sideby side
but at the same time there are some disappointing informations
as the rapporteur has stated we tackled very important topics like fragmews with all blowers gm and licences always defending freedom of expression which is the crucial and essential point of our concern
and now we have a decision that for the ~ first ] time in this ` parliament ] is rejected by all the political groups by all the committees with the huge majority almost unimity
i almost feel sorry for the commission
madam president it is hard to believe that we are sitting here @ today ] discussing minor changes to the rules of value added to
no doubt the justures towards the % european union ] will continue but democratically elected governments have a primary interest in looking after the populations that elected them
never mind that prudent government for nances are essential to the survival of the euro there is nothing else that these countries can do about their budgets
probably an even more serious concern is the huge exposure of children * eurosone ] countries to the defaulting debt of eastern * europe ]
i therefore ask the commission to urge the implementation of local primary health strategy to embrass health livestile awareness campaigns and the early introduction of screening programmes across * europe ] so that we can meet our goals of healthy ageing by @ twenty twenty ]
billing in mind the guidelines for collerating cancel screening from @ two thousand and ten ] @ last week ] i hosted the conference with a launch widepaper setting the standards for the prevention dignosis treatment and care of collerating cancel across * europe ]
if we take so long with the rule of locountry like % singer ] poor imagine how long we will take with bigger more prolimatic countries
with cyber criminals getting better at breaking into protected networks i strongly believe that the only real way to win the buttle is to have people with similar knowledge and expertise fighting against them
the president even thought i thought i thought you message that i should not ask for the floor i do it at any way
i do think that it is actually a fundamental right to have a basic banking account
governments feel their scepticism of public opinion and tried to transfer responsibility to their commission
so the % eu ] is an hypocritical situation where the ` council ] does not approve gm ose but some member states cultivate them
usually our group is proper and of community approach but in this particular case we should not have ! one ] cites of policy
the inclusion of complementary environmental reasons as well as list of social conomic grounds for the restriction or prohibition of their engi ows by member states will make this report more legally solid
mr president any operator that is responsible for damage to the environment must be held procountable for their actions
however the determination of the accountability should be down to the member of state
you mentioned the establishment of a ~ secondary ] liability regime based upon the systems already adopted by several members of state
this is typical of the % eu ] implementing more or more a necessary legislation
the report calls for the consideration of a ) european ] fund for the remedy of environmental damage
so if you propose this fund who is going to pay for it
the implementation of the ` council ] decision of @ twenty six ] of april @ two thousand and four ] would greatly encourage % turkey ] to implement the ` ecr ] association agreement
as meps i hope that we can send a strong message on behalf of those citizens that we are in favour of a free internet where the privacy of users and their rights are respected fully we must stand behind the bluck of citizens amendments that have been tabled as the best way of defending those rights of our citizens
these amendments if passed will restore some source of balance between endures rights and freedoms and the rights and freedoms of others including the right to intellectual property protection and indeed the right to protection and indeed the right to provicy
the aim of this proposal should be to protect those who need protection but also to strengthen the rights of citizens to access information within the law when and where they see fish
service providers should be made act in a transparent market manner at all times and if in very exceptional cases restrictions to access are required they should be fully accountable in justifying these restrictions
national powers should have a role in investigating any restriction that serves providers impose
for the moment the cotral clending undertaken by & dush ] at other precious sides they have seized has not taken place that parliamer one of the greatest of all cotral treasures of the * middle east ]
indeed the destruction of such sides is in fact country to ) islamic ] scollership where previous civilisations and the learning and architector of antiquity was studied preserved often incorporated and in a positive sense used
as my colleague } borroso jonson ] the mair of % london ] has put it this is not a clash of civilisations
as a former % un esco ] willed heritish sight chairman myself the thought that this wondrous juel could be destroyed concerns me and so many others deeply never forgetting the probably over ! a thousand ] people who have lost their lives in and around the sight
@ two ] additionally there are separate votes under manments @ twenty six ] ! thirty six ] ! forty six ] ! seventy one ] and
they all concern the same issue that we are now lost so i proposed that we vote all of this in the block
member states because in the digital single market more and more personal data of people from ! one ] country member state will be collected store and used in other member states
they were to have some effect but i think we need to take attention of the loopholes
they collaborate supporting each other
so in this regard we really would like to see in a future much more pro active and cooperative for all from commission side otherwise it will be very difficult for us to cooperate
however modern commissioner there was a key measure missing from your proposal
a unique sense of ownership of sea and its resources and a real form of resolisation will be established i want to call upon all members of this ` parliament ] to give this measure some ! tea ] and vote for amendment ! two hundred and fifty three ]
it will allow us to restore feast and increase the income of fishermen throughout the % european union ] by increasing both the quantity and the size of fiscal
if albania engages in this reform process according to very welcome the constitutional reform } albania ] has been successfully going through which is a very very difficult task we all understand that but we also know that when it comes to judicial reform it is the implementation which the most difficult and most implementation which the implementation will develop welcome the constitutional reform
mr president i think that is a very reasonable question and yes of course we can only use market
a fingure should also use other instruments like regulation for instance
we have just adopted energy efficiency directive that will definitely also put us in directive
because this is a huge massive problem that needs a fundamental change in the way we consumer produce energy
this is what we have now and that is the ` ecb ] system
probably know how busy we are
@ four ] ! thousand days ] and nights @ nearly eleven years ]
i would like to congratulate them further participant in the twitter side and have to say that i am more than surprised and impressed about how much information is on that side from the % european union ] it cases a huge amount of information and i would like to congratulate them further
i am sure that this quest for freedom is universal and that the % eu ] has a moral obligation and a strategic interest to avoid most tragedies in the * mediterranean ] by promoting peace security under rule of law in a more firm and assertive way in the countries of origin
she was thankful for reaching the free world she became really happy only when her homeland was finally freed from oppression and eventually we came back to % croatia ]
we know that there is a shortage of skilled labour in the ) syria ] at the same time there are lots of people who will lose their jobs and will need retraining
we hope that we will go all together
the desea must improve the framework for digital service provides to stimulate growth but it must also make the fight against illegal contents more successful and it must improve the tense parency and the oversight
ideority will i base on our own values and we have the economic benefits or we enterp using ` eib ] developed on other countinents we doubt those values and we doubt a large part of the economic benefits
the strong risk based approach offers the best way forward here these challenges are difficult but i fully support the effect the efforts of all the rapporteurs here @ today ] and we are not even close to satisfy legal situation but these reports are in excellent starts
and some people born in a different time like myself might want to go back to how it was before because it seems to like a simple time
the future will be more digital not less and it brings incredible progress that we as policy makers should embrace
we cannot think ignore any more
let us be honest with each other colleagues the % eu ] has done more to regulate the own line world than any other countinents
over the past degates we have not followed up illegal content and illegal activities online with the same regard as illegal activities offline
we have not achieved any meanful transparency overhow elegal items boosh content to users on a messive scale
we have not grasped the impact of it on our democracies our culture and our fundamental rights
instead we have focused on voluntary cooperation which is good but not good enough
not nearly good enough
we cannot leave this over to the private sector without oversight and enforcement we must keep this in the public debate as a priority and we must erregulate no matter how dynical these files hard
the difficult challenge before us is to find a balance between digital progress and respect of indemental rights
the value of law making is the real chair change its effects
if we start off with conflicting regulations and directives that undermine each other instead of complementing each other we have lost the battle before it starts
we must respect the scope of each digital file
~ secondly ] the fendamental of the e commerce directive were great but its greatest issue was transparency
we must improve and enforce meanful transparency and i call for a clear mandate from this ` parliament ]
% turkly ] we all agree on the importance of notice and action mechanisms to remove illegal content online but this places the burden almost entirely unusers we therefore should compliment notice and action before clear appropriate obligations to remove illegal content and its public authorities which should provide offending to follow up online
finally i would like to course personally to thank all the shadow reporteurs and all my colleagues on the lebate deaser report for their excellent cooperation
they stablished sumpariorities
to our children and young people who have to pass not titles and theoretical topics but above all practical values
indeed a ducation and culture have to do with civil ingestion
golden vices make a negative impact on the status of % eu ] residence and citizenship
let me outline briefly what the commission is already doing to improve is this plemantation
we are warried by the deteriorating situation when it comes to respect for human rights persecution of political opponents as well as journalists is becoming a rule in this country for of contrast the country which is on the one hand incredibly reached in oil and diamonds and on the other hand has ! one ] of the hast raised raised of child more tality in the world
it is the corrupted airlites who are depriving the people of % angual ] of their basic human rights access to health care full education by stilling public money intended for basic social services we are seriously concerned about the possible mismanagement of % eu ] development funds by the ` local authorities ] and in this regard we are requesting from the commission to review the national indicative programme and the & eu ] development funds by the & local authorities ] who are depriving the people of
mr president after the case of conflict instability and goal continues to face major challenges if we govern us
however it should be a decision taken by the % eu ] as a whole and of course coordinated with the ` us tourkey ] and the & arab link ]
it is important that & facebook ] is not only doing adds as they say is their business model but also deliver for trust in a way of delivering solutions and actions in the way of how they do their business model
i would also agree it is very important to understand that there is a missing brick in this war and that is the eprivacy regulation
we need to get more rules and place especially also for consumer control to get connectivity across the platforms in order to have a choice
business model of just earning money by endeavouring the data of individuals has to change because that is not only the business model
we still need to face that problem because the communication data needs to be protected in a specific way
so we can be very proud of the % european union ] and especially of ` parliament ] that we have a tool to protect the privacy and integrity of our citizens life with the ` gdpr ] in place
it is about fundamental rights privacy of warness but privacy enforcement as well namely the right to be forgotten enshrined by the ` european union ]
but it is also about democracy because fake news is a high red war of intoxication many political lies and hates peach aimed to weaken democracy through interfering innovations and inhancing populism and * european ] so it takes a response ) european ] which means that no member state can do it on its own before effective law
that is what the ) european ] citizens are expecting from all of us and that is precisely and exactly what we ask from you
the commission must take initiative action and now
reporting the ) zwalus ] is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of the % european union ] because the ` guarantee demember states fulfilled their international low obligations and that they contrast each other and the institutions of the % european union ]
the % european union ] was founded on the principles of respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights
we are failing to do so many have several consequences including the possibility of the % european union ] to fall apart almost @ years ] by a since its foundation
right before our ice
this report also has other important implications for the fundamental rights of minorities roma children women and agebity people and for those seeking asylum
this was proved in the last coupil of years this must be rectified that is why in this report we call for a new mechanism that is ultimately triggered in case of breaches of fundamental values and rights to remedy the breaches to avoid demotralisation of systematic trades in member states our common ) european ] fundamental values are
do you know focus that we mean that vivial businessing some targets
too many mandates and at the same time can lead to fragmentation and to high crust
so we should keep finding the ribalance and finding the trade of to be focused and efficient in the work and ` eib ]
through venues programmes and exchange of best practices and know how and by ensuring the availability of necessary finding for education training agreements raising and empirement of women as well as for the continuous fight against ingender vigolence start types and discrimination
it is about jobs and it is about money
i understand that we are involved in a big legal battle of this norway and i believe that we can find enough good lawyers to win this battle
it is about ) european ] citizens thrust into ) european ] commission and institutions
just let me give you ! few ] examples
mr president all other members i have listened carefully to the debate @ today ] and i am incouraged by the commissioner
we need to speak vitally quality we need to counteract raises and senefobia
i was in the rivals horse waiting to go out through customs when we heard and felt the ~ first ] explosion
no rifles or surveillance technology in the world can do that
then the ~ second ] explosion and some of us thought that the roof was coming down upon us
my body remembers that fear and it is in that feeling that i refuse those who say that we have to learn to live with this terrorism is man made and we can undo it
it is the moment to step back for a moment to just pause and think through the implications of our actions and in our
are we taking the right measures to invest massively into better equipment and better cooperation of our police and security services and into effective deradicalisation or are we still putting forward expensive and simbolic measures against completely innocent citizens
thereby weakening effective security and our freedoms together which we defend
therefore i am very happy that commissioner } king ] is starting to investigate into the effectiveness of the ( european union ] and its member states has adopted throughout the years
if this is what you are calling for then we will come back in * europe ]
however the most offensive position that you have taken is the proposal that spain will have the right to be to any brexit deal over the issue of % gibraltar ]
i do however have a solution to prevent } gibraltar ] being used as a parliament in brexit negotiations and indeed end spanish claims wants and for all make gibraltar a fully integrated part of the % uk ]
i have been calling this for many years and with the % unique ] opportunities that % brexit ] has given us i believe it is an idea whose time has come
give % gibraltar ] real influence and the voice in * westminster ] and send a clear message that % gibraltar ] is not for sale
give here and our other oversight servitories their own member of ` parliament ]
in this area we the % uk ] can lend from our continental cousins because the french give representation to their oversight territories and i propose that we should to
this i guarantee would cause amends damage to the economies of the % european union ] and good results in putting many of your citizens out of work it is what we call in the % uk ] cutting off your nose to spite your face
i want to make it clear in this chamber @ today ] the people of % gibraltar ] are proudly ) british ] in @ two thousand and two ] ! ninety nine ] of ) gibraltarians ] voters in a referendum against shared sovereignty with % spain ]
~ first ] our position our attitude at pro committed pro ) europeans ] is very well described in hamlet when a rassia describes the expression of the father of % hamlet accountance ] more in sorrow than in anger that will be our attitude in our negotiation
i will just underline ! four ] ideas that seem to me of the utmost importance on the subject
however it is a step that should not be taken lightly
to me as an envy mep the effects of climate change to the rights of internet people are well very close to my heart because warming climate is to direct or indirect cause for many of the violations against their rights
we need to understand and be aware of that
budget consolidation needs to be complimented by a social investment strategy that will address the social employment in adducation tackets of the % eu two thousand and twenty strategy ]
i had no answer but his office refused to respond to my emails
gender diversity on burns leads to more sustainable decisions and therefore emer resistant ) european ] economy
i would therefore like to stress again the importance of reaching first reading agreement on an issue which is so important to the % european union ] citizens
% stonia ] has chosen ! four ] main objectives for the @ next six month ]
the logical order of these ! four objectives ] seems clear the inclusive and sustainable * europe ] that % stonia ] wants to promote as the ~ fourth ] objective will be closer if the ~ first ] ! three ] objectives are achieved
these regals may certainly firstly date are more inclusive and sustainable
i am confident and convinced that in the months to come % stonia ] will go in the direction of the nouncing annual bridge of fundamental rights in the % european union ]
question develibity of reach to do so because so far we have not yet restricted ! one ] single substance using the reach system
that was my question if it is really appropriate and it will be if it will work
let me say that such a policy chief would be a strategic blunder the % eu ] should continue to do what it is doing only do it better
therefore i would say that recent events in % russia ] and the presidential elections actually present a case for staying the course in terms of our policy
) iran ] 's some of its citizens as threats repression happens to real people people with family and friends
questioning is basically what is the commission doing to prevent execution of the innocent people who only dream occressing freedom
since the ) irene ] options are limited and their cashfloor is limited and their foreign currencies are not limited they might very well offer as quippro quo navel basis or air basis to % russian ] or % chinese military ] in the * middle east ] and this is of course all bad news very bad news for anyone but also in the % european union ]
as a coordinated for the ` jsp ] which we fully support and also as a diplomatic success from the % european union ] i would ask you in the @ next eleven days ] and beyond to do your utmost best
i admit most viables or dependent on who makes the decisions in the @ beginning of next year ] in % washington ] but right now at @ next couple of months ] we have an expiring weapons in % bargo ] and there is no movement from the % us ] aid to be expected i would create a daunting challenge from the % us ] aid to be expected
the alternative means that to find a solution is welcome because basing will sell its arms
the same page
our talks with * europe ] with basing in % moscow ] on going can you assure me that we are doing everything that we can and to restrain
the ) iranian ] foreign minister has welcomed it an eleven days from now like the ) islamic ] revolutionary } god cour ] has said a new faith in military cooperation between % iran ] and the world will commend
debates however seem to be concentrating on who ever gets the ticket in the wide house
still hope to limit arm seals
no way then a peaceful solution out of this long conflict international peace needs to be an international end over
it is therefore absolutely unacceptable that the countries are turkey for example contributes with mercineries among other things to worse in the situation even more the % eu ] is the region billed on their deal that dialogue is the only way forward for long losting peace it is our duty at the same time to take leadership for those ideas in our neighbouring countries
i am glad that the international communities ready to assist any unity to support the ongoing process in % us ] sea
that is what we have to improve and i really appreciate that you are taking this on your agenda and i would really see that member states are supporting you in making better use of these systems
so yes in the beginning of this huge transition we will still need for so fews and therefore % eu ] policies should support carbon capture and able government support schemes for blue hideragen i expect the commission to move forward in this direction in its energy summer backage
our biggest problem is that the perfect is becoming the enemy of the good
infrastructure in the scale of electralises but also in carbon capture utilisation and storage because we need to be realistic
well all together that is not a sustainable postume
luckly there is ! one ] 's econology we all agree on that has the potential to decarbonise at least our heavy industries and transport hidragen
we have @ thirty years ] to reshape our entire energy system and we can do it we will fail if we demand to be perfect but we will definitely succeed by doing it as good as we can
and just look at the political debates no new clear energy please no carbon capture that untils fossil fuels no biomas no gas in a transition no windmills in my back yard and no solar penals on agricultural grounds please
how can it possibly be serious in reaching our climate goals without technologies like garbon capture by ` omas ] on % nuclear ]
it might not be a silver bullet but we all agree this energy carrier has enormous potential and our aim is clear to create a new clean produce green high region markets and a long term certainty for all parties involved and that requires massive investments
if we want to pave the way for clean hideragen reinitially will be to invest intransitional technologies and these might not be perfect but they are good
welcoming criminals into our % european union ] with open arms just because those criminals are rich is totally outrageous and means for feeding that trust because the regard is of what the ) syparian ] or any other governments thinks the access
@ two ] ! eu ] country passport also means the access to the whole % eu ] with all the benefits that takes years for normal people to enjoy even though they might have been extemplary habitants
this is not having a sincere cooperation nor is it upholding the integrity of what an % eu ] citizenship should mean convicted oligarchs and corrupt businessmen have nothing to do here in the % eu ]
the ~ second ] is also why does the theat include all the countries who have this kind of system in place referring to the infringement process of course
in this respect we welcome on efforts to maintain common safety standards to put in place vicause protection measures strict controls and training in safety procedures as well as for enforcing regular risk assessment and preventing measures by employers
we should not be hypocritical cleaning formally to the letter of the treaty and taking it as a ) christian ] as an excuse to look aside from the real situation
hindering the livery of tangible benefits for our citizens and posing problems for those wishing to live work or do business across borders it is time to people at the heart of % eu ] policy making by dentifying problematic areas dismantling citizens barriers and improving primplementation in % ways ] which result in concrete benefits in the daily lives of our citizens
i am harming competition they are creating unfair a increasing inequality
maybe most of them are actual egal but they met not only because in views of many people they are immoral they met her because they are harming our society
we cannot only read by example but more decisively used suffering hard powers to pursue the others that are making the game and fair
in some cases do not be afraid to go for harmonisation
this is the moment where i have to turn to finance ministers because they have the power
much to be worried about presecution of opposition and journalists and therefore i think the % eu ] has to stand up ~ first ] of the ` european balance ] and condition enhanced cooperation on convincing progress in the field of human rights
that 's evident from the recently leaked cables with ! one ] participant stating it is impressive to see how some member states present themselves outwardly as proponents of tax reforms and at the same time to watch in the code of conduct group how they actually behave any new discussions protected by confidentiality
i actually listen to my constituents and i know they are furious about tax dodging both businesses and individuals
as i said there is no union for complacency and many things have to be done
ahead of the meeting as we know some % eu ] leaders voice concerns about external dectablising influences on the region and these happen mentioned again @ tonight ]
i believe our response has to be ever more visible and strong engagement in the region to support those forces that fight for human rights and the rule of law
the % eu ] is a peace project a project that aims to end frequent and bloody wars between neighbours horrible experiences that the * western bolkins ] know only too well
the prospects of ) european ] integration from % montenegro ] and the * western balkans ] is therefore essential for peace in the region and across * europe ]
as the commissioner noted montinegro continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to % eu ] integration
its steady progress in opening chapters is it only bringing it closer to % eu ] accession but as many others have said is also providing a positive example for other countries in the region
my group tables a number of amendments to the report 's specifically focused on enhancing human rights
i am pleased that many of these are reflected in the reports covering topics from ensuring media freedom to improving working conditions for civil society to better arrangements for victims of gender based violence to eliminating obstacles to healthcare education hizing and employment for roman people
i am referring to that because we are at the crossroads
i think the fast track the commission and ` parliament ] is now attributing is an achievement because it is bottom up
a ~ second ] issue which is important and also an achievement for ` parliament ] is we are reflecting that we are living in an ever changing enovation environment it is new its fast by a vicc capital and its competitive
but we failed
tackle children 's cancel
we for the ~ first ] time do not fight the fight between several reduction and competitivenesses that we just focus on energy production what we are going to do is yes it is not a contradiction to do see reduction and to be competitive but we have to do something about that and that is the focus on manufacturing we want to have see ! two ] free steel plans
leading but we have to do something about that leadership and we want to do want to have a continued confuger in @ ten years ] from now
it is not for standay speeches it is not for the sake of the ecodemic life it is about the substance of the well being of that continent
the reason why of the well being of that continent relates starting in the @ eighteen century ] on its ability to innovate
this is the compenent which is opened to the world
we do not want to have the ) america ] ~ firstly ] the % united states ]
we have fast enough in the international context
the historic legacy of enlightment is very much related to that
but we want to ask the world to work together with us
we have more of a bottom up approach
we want to have more of an ambition but we want to align care to reduction and competition
i think what is important to understand is that this is not yet another programme that is ! one ] of the biggest contribution to the ` european ] economy but also to the well being of the ) european ] citizens
i think what we are going to achieve with that programmes first of all we are going big we tackling the big challenges which are related to the ordinary life of citizens
we can in terms of technology we want to have a quantim computer
if you are smart if you are smart if you are smart if you are innovative you go to the commission in you could say in the framework of what had been decided in the programme do we get funded
investment to the labour of our working population in * europe ] but the basis of our well being is innovation
by the ` dprk ] on a ! south korean ] % ireland ]
we also expect % china ] to clearly condemn this act
there have been severe casualties among the southcare in military and especially under the civilian population of that ireland
we welcome that % barroness assian ] the high representative 's action in a concerned manner with other international actors our allies and our strategic partner the republic of corea in condemning this clear violation of the % un ] corean ) corean ] amaz agreement
we call upon the ` dprk ] avoid any further escalation and to undertake all necessary efforts to maintain peace and stability on the creain peninsula
such prevention presupposes major commitment as well as sustained and consessed efforts by the commission by national governments of countries experiences such fenomenon by the civil society its national agencies and other stakeholders
mr president against women preventing them to fully enjoy equal treatment in employment and educational opportunities in many countries
this is her raising but underlyposed problem in several countries
what i am talking about
but even worse than those billions is prostration and anger when attories and artists and we love them we prove this today a company proprietor or a worker a student a patient or a doctor cannot find those necessary information afformed to fill out when the ` heroshia ] encounters problems when delivering those problems and i find it especially important
we would all like to see jobs back in * europe ]
we just had a very good discussion on youth unemployment earlier to this discussion and i really think that we have an obligation to look into all possibilities of supporting growth and job creation
in this perspective ! one ] might be minor but important thing could be imploying financial participation fp
` efp ] can strengthen small and medium sized enterprises offering mechanisms for innovative financing as workers may wish to invest in chairs in their own company by which they are employed
despite these possible benefits the focus on % eib ] various from member state to member state
this is a reason for me to participate in this very important debate @ today ] because when it comes to imploy the share ownership and employ the financial participation the commission and ` parliament ] as was mentioned by my colleague from the ` european union ] has been talking a lot of
we have done starters and we have collected information data and knowledge
now i think it is time to act
i would like to ask the commissioner a very simple question
are you planning to put forward a proposal for an action plan on this issue
we have adopted an opinion on employing financial participation we have made several studies we have adopted a resolution we have completed a pilot project and so on as
i am sure that this was a mistaken i hope you will fixc that
important the catching our region initiative has helped for example to improve their condition for starting the business the management to financial instruments or special planning practices
i understand very word that some of you may seem that we are demanding too much but on the other hand we all know that children seems equality of governance hinders the penformance of public investments
very much welcomes our main finding of these reports
instead of reinstating border checks and undermining ! one ] of the % eu ] 's fundamental freedoms we need closer coordination among our security and law enforcement agencies instead of gettering ever greater amounts of tata and undermine civil debates vinite more effective intelligent chailing to connect the dots from the information we already collect
this is the way in which this polish authority this ) polish ] government this polish majority acts
so failure for it was totally right when she explained it it is absolute
we are all run
we have no idea what is happening there
they are all wrong and they are all right
the problem in pollen is that they are trying to change the state and to model it so that generations to come will have no chance to change it back for the better
that is the thing that we have to be concerned about because there are ! the millions ] and ( millions ] of poles probably ! one half ] of them more than ! one half of them that would still make up a pretty big member state who want a future in * europe ]
who wanted about critic future
those poles we are standing up for because they have chosen to be part of the ` european society ] and that is why we care
they send their children to % special ] so called ) european ] school which is completely isolated from the rest of the world
our missages discover your talent
at that time we were focused upon the whole business of the modernisation of competition policy the significant amount of work taken forward by former commissioner } maria monte ] and by the current commissioner } neal crews ] and looking at the impact of that in terms of the commission 's ability to deal with the commission 's ability to deal with the commission 's ability to deal with the commission 's ability to deal with the
we have seen record activity on the part of the commission in terms of dealing with hardcaurt cartels we have seen the development of the lenience system we have seen record fines put into operation by the commission and we have seen record activity in terms of murgers and state aid notifications as well
but i mentioned the change of contacts because of course we all recognise that since the reports were published by the commission the commission 's working terms of state aid particularly has really taken on a rather different dimension
it is being undertaken and it is very important and our report says so that in addressing those matters we recognise some of the challenges that there are for an effective open market
in the banking sector in the % united kingdom ] at the moment is ! one ] very clear area where there will have to be when economic circumstances become a little carmor a general review of the new architecture that we have got and whether that architecture really is compatable with the operation of a free fair and open market
mr president the commission produces its annual competition report and it is traditional for the ` european parliament ] to cast its eye over the report and produce an initiative reaction to it
that is something similarly that our committee and ` parliament ] has been supported of
in this case because of timing factors the reports for ! two thousand and six ] and ! two thousand and six ] and ! seven ] have been brought together but taking up ! one ] of the points mentioned by commissioner } barro ] a little bit earlier it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather marketly since in fact we began the exercise of consideration the consideration of the marketly since in fact we began the exercise because because of time ago
our committees drawn attention to ! two ] specific concerns what we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers particularly in relation to food retailing % eu ] to food retailing % eu ] to food retailing
it is very important that when the commission gives its approval it is giving that approval in ways which are compatable with the treaty and do not create such significant market power in future that that becames a synorio for abuse in its own right
almost on a daily basis the commission is now looking at the effect of the bailights that are taking place in the context of the great financial termoil
by enlarge that has been a very good story in these reports and that is very clear from the reaction that we have from ` parliament ] 's own report
this is a process that is gathering pays in terms of modernisation because the commission is currently bringing forward proposals in a wide paper on introducing private damages
to me as an envy mep the effects of climate change to the rights of internet people are well very close to my heart because warming climate is to direct or indirect cause for many of the violations against their rights
we need to understand and be aware of that
incentive during negotiations has to lie in the implementation of the commitments taken by % gapan ] to illiminate nontary various in various sectors particularly in the automotive sector
now is not the time to say let us wait a few more months or we need more concessions now is the time to launch negotiations with % gapan ]
we cannot accept that our ! two ] way trade with the world ~ third ] largest national economy is only a court of our trade with the ` us ] or % china ]
to ensure this i included a provision that the ` gapan ] has not delivered on its mtp commitments and has not demonstrated sufficient ambition in meeting the % eu ] 's priority demands the commission should stop negotiations with the ` european parliament ] and the ` council ]
the commission has estimated that nearly ! two thirds ] of these guests of the % eu ] strate policy would come from potential agreements with the ` us ] and % gapan ]
yes @ two days ago ] something happened ! one ] port and the sunner airport were reopened but it is far from being enough
we have to put productive things on a table
i think you do everything you can but you also have to admit that sometimes some countries are blucking but you also have to admit that sometimes some countries are blucking
pollen are now going to be president so we need to put a maximum pressure on pollen to live up to that responsibility
this is why we cannot wait to two thousand and twenty ] this is why it is all very well that we will get a legally binding agreement in @ two thousand and fifteen ] but the coup process needs to create other results long before that
this will only happen if the % eu ] shows direction and to be honest we haven done that for @ a few years ]
can i ask you ! one ] ) christian ] commissioner why
it is that ! one ] country can block progress for the % european union ]
this will only happen if the % eu ] leads
normally we are very polite and do not mention them but @ today ] i would like to mention poland unfortunately because poland has been blocking
i value your work commissioner
it will seriously help help us speed up the base of negotiations and give the global climate agreement achance
put this ready maps in line with the commissioner 's on policy and a strategy
mr president the commission has recently provided help to the ` hungarian ] government in order to manage the floors of migrants entering the country
it should at least make sure that the gates are not closed to people who are not having badgets
that is called investment
in hongery i suppose that in the good old days when they were still running newspaper adds in order to sell their passports that the money had to be transferred into an offshore account that apparently belonged to the government of honour
is no passport and no citizenship by investment
there is an issue that is citizenship by identification integration merit belief in what we stand for as nations and as % european union ]
ms } commissioner ] i know that the commission has limited means of action in this but condemned the practice pleased as clearly and as enequivocally as this house does because only then i will go to get the more reluctant moment member states to realise that what they do is wrong
unfortunately even the change is introduced by committee do not go far enough in improving the proposal
i am baffled at the notion of extending the term of copy right whether it is @ to seventy years ] or @ ninety five years ] and i am baffled by it not just because it is jubious and almost out of step with the digital age but also because quite clearly amoved like that will primarily
i believe not withstanding all of the hard work and good will that meps should reject this proposal
it is a proposal which i believe will ultimately reward those arties that are all ready successful and indeed reward the industry
i think the commission needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with the right proposal one that is not just about at apporting performers and artists but that in real and practical terms will deliver precisely that
for all ) iraq ] citizens in general and the ! two ] men in particular because they have been numerously targeted on a logical scale
this attack claimed the life of a forty two etnic turkeymen and wanted on other one
therefore the % eu ] should work closely with the ` iraqi ] government and use all the tools at its disposal to encourage the ) iraqi ] government to provide adequate protection to the ) turkey ] man and other minorities
this resolution is not just for the took mand to it is for all the minority communities of * europe ] who long for peace and security
! security ] and protection despite the findings of ) iraqi ] 's own high commission for human rights which acknowledge that % turkey ] men have been subjected to terrorism bombings kidnappings and assistanation neither the federal government of % iraq ] nor the ) curtish ] regional government have done enough to provide security and protection
emission limits if no road mobile machinery might not sound like the sexiest subject but it is an important piece of the technol when it comes to tackling airpollution
the ` un inconvenient truth for those who should argue the environmental benefits of ) britain ] outside the % eu ] is that airpollution has an unfortunate hebit of not respecting borders
rather than allowing menefacturers to undercut each others in a raise to libatim on environmental standards these ambitions and binding measures of an aram will assure industry is manufacturing progressively cleaner engles for these machines which will go a long way to cleaning attoxical pollution in the % eu ]
over ! one ] ! third ] of the % uk ] 's airpolution is blown in from across the * english channel ]
this proposal is a perfect example of how trade in a common market can also deliver environmental and health benefits for citizens
always suffered quite a lot of delays in many respects and always we wanted to have our limits lower and higher etc
but now a streat rule in real vision to the future is something that we have to tell the people because this is the truth that our environment is in having danger
congratulations again to the rapporteur
the % eu ] 's cap on banker 's bonicis was challenged by the ) british ] government but largely supported by the ) british ] people just as they support action to make c op more accountable
a survey of members that the institute of directors showed smes felt high pay in some big businesses was harming the reputation of all businesses

mr president the ` single monitor barroso ] } nomal group ] bodies resolutely democratic the president the single market is one of the most tangible results of ) european ] integration and yet despite its significant achievements citizens consumers and businesses have become increasingly dissatisfied with it as it often fails to convince
the main problem is doing the everage citizen 's eyes the market is more concerned with vested interests than it is with their needs
we need to start working towards a fairer single market that is politically supported economically reviable socially acceptable by ) european ] citizens a market that stimulates sustainable economic growth and job creation but also considers citizens hopes fears and expectations
the common report is an important step towards achieving a strong green knowledge based social market economy which by turning its focus back to its people will become a common asset of all its citizens reduce and employment poverty inequalities social exclusion and wage dumping promote respect of fundamental
therefore i urge meps to support report and in particular the measures aim that endorsing highly competitive social market economy providing consumers with the highest level of protection promoting innovative start ups smes and social economy enterprises opposing abuses in the single market which are trying to circumvent existing rules lower

we also count on the ` european parliament ] to make sure that the % eu ] voice is more vitally heart and we appreciate very much the outrage efforts that you have made in the past
in addition to the shared devision for long term action to mitigation and technology and adaptation the identification of appropriate means for financing effective and long term climate policies will be key in the % eu ] further deliberations
for the adoption of this package in @ a few months ] time the % eu ] will demonstrate that its commitment as well as its leadership in the global fight against climate change are as strong as ever
} parliament ] has also sent the message that the current financial crisis is not to be seen as an obstacle for further action on climate change but its instead as yet another opportunity for transforming profoundly our economic system and moving firmly towards a low economic system and moving firmly towards a low carbon economic system and moving firmly towards a low carbon economic system
of course the % eu ] has repeatedly said that it were not settled for ! twenty ] we want to go for ! thirty ] and therefore we hope for an ambitious global and comprehensive agreement in % copenhagen ]
! one ] of the key elements of any comprehensive global agreement
as you know the work during the presidency of the focus on the international negotiation process
their tireless affords have greatly contributed to us shaping the % eu ] position on climate change
just by the way i am leaving % strasboke ] @ today ] flying today discussing with the ` indian ] government and ) indian ] representatives
i have preliminary proposed her a high level meeting with the % us ] representatives and the % eu ] commissioner } dimas ] the check presidency and the upcoming swedish presidency that means draka
the ` copenhagen conference ] is now only @ ten month ] away this did @ december ] % posinan ] climate conference a greet on a work programme for @ two thousand and nine ] with crearly identified steps towards copenhagen the decision in % posinan ] on the operationalisation of the adoptation fund represents an important step forward
the minister } roundable imposine ] has also confirmed the shared willingness both the developed and developing countries to find an effective global agreed response to dangerous climate change for the post @ two thousand and twenty twelve ] period this continues emphasis further mitigation efforts ] adaptation actions and technology means to make that response operation
as far as the ` east ] is concerned a single % eu ] cap will with a lineral downward trajectory will be set octioning will be gradually introduced as the method of allocating allowances and moritoring reporting and verification will be strengthened
the ` czech ] presidency intends to build on such important achievements and to pursue efforts at international level towards a successful agreement in @ copenhagen ] in @ december two thousand and nine ] in @ march ] the ~ second ] and % violence ] of your input
~ first ] of all let me congratulate through you the temporary committee on climate change for all the work that it has accomplished since its creation in @ april two thousand and seven ] hearings conferences reports resolutions exchanges with ~ third ] parties
in this context i can only rate to rate this committee 's call on the commission and the member states i quote at pilotary level in the negotiations towards @ eight two thousand and twelve ] agreement and a mediating grow between the position of developed countries in order to ensure by means of a balance
right at the moment my fears to go beyond concerns about basic human rights i fear war and i want to depeat devision that speaks to this fear
human rights will be no not mother % eurota ]
therefore i would like to express my gratitude to the founders of the * euro ] and the organisations of the price in % salute ] and } salute ] whose fight for human rights and freedom became an excellent opportunity to talk about human beings
no longer take my commere into the heart of the society and to and do the only think that i know how to do field making this is a slow death for a field making field
making the life of many miserable while using the most inacceptable accusers difference of raise language religion of political ideas and fortunately the authorities of my country are becoming so entolerant
this love goes away beyond the jographical budget i still do not know if this interpretation was correct however if it was i never understood why i had to leave my country but i love it dearly this love goes away beyond the jographical budget
madam president when any form of factistic work or practice was vulnished and instead all you have is an area of approach conforming bedwiser humans perhaps and realistic to some
my creation is a result of personal recept perception of life and on tological experiences in my specific society during @ a lifetime ] rhand or live with this world of the domicalist about my head that was
national so today is the outstanding example of such a situation study enough we can go on maturing many cases of extreme injustice in % iran ] and in many other countries our own world however this is not money and tension today
let me be clear * european ] integration can indeed transform the politics and economics of candidate countries as it has done in my country but it cannot construct democratic legitimacy of states and their institutions
in this respect i am highly appreciative of commissioner } barnier ] 's strong amidment to take into account a citizen 's concerns and auspirations
in my opinion the single market is not getting the political support agently needed to ensure it does not become yesterday 's business
more political leadership on the single market from the presidents of the commission and ` council ] would go a long way towards achieving a viable single market to serve as a catalyst for economic regovery
we must not lose this political momentum and unique opportunity to revitalise the single market
i repeat that market integration is not an irreversible process and must not be taken for granted
there are not ~ first ] glass and ! second ] glass countries
but } schengen ] will not be complited and will all members who want to be part of it have the chance to join
they exist only on maps and in the head of those who want to destroy their % union ]
! four hundred million ] nationals of more than ( twenty five ] different estates travelling free with no busk or check with no border controls and within a single country this is what ) europeans ] have accomplished and we have to be very proud of it
in this situation a trying to politicise this debate with different issues a huge mistake ~ first ] because these ! three ] countries are not in the same situation and ~ second ] because the accession to schengen cannot be mixsed with the cooperation and berification mechanism
the decision on the accession to } schengen ] must be based on technical createria and the labelle based on political recents is simply unacceptable
as it was already said it is difficult to imagine the % european union ] @ today ] without changing
this is a very tangible expression of our solidarity of the freedom and unity of ) european ] citizens and it brings a lot of economic benefits but not for ) europeans ]
it is about great ability if we as % union ] follow our own rules
~ second ] the economic benefits will bring benefits to all citizens of the % european union ]
instead of wasting money for internal controls we should strengthen through resources enough financing the external borders of the % union ]
also we often complain that to the european forces populars arguments against the % european union ]
this is ! one ] of the cases because it shows injustice to ! two ] ) european ] citizens and now the ` european council ] has to do its job which is not performed an injustice has to be stopped
are you aware that the % united states ] % swedzond ] and % germany ] that are true and historic federations they do not have a single national constituency
are you aware that this will be inforced the weight of the beak states because it is natural that in the ~ first ] places of its list there will be nationals from the bigger states and this will show provide the position of % ireland ] portugal
this is a quite important
mr president i have ! three ] shudged ! three ] messages ! one ] for all colleagues ! one ] for president } two ] and the other for the commission and i will be very sharp very loud and very clear
but we have made a huge progress and i am very worried with this idea of an extraordinary council on the composition of the ` european parliament ] this is a competence in the power of our ` parliament ] that then is to be approved by the ` council ] it is true but we have made a huge progress and i as a professor of constitution and law
the ` council ] should be aware of these in any case
for this reason the % european union ] must pay close attention to the deteriorating human rights situation of the ) european commitment ] not only because it is our duty but also because this situation is directly associated with stability in the larger middle east region
the ` european parliament ] resolution adopted on @ fourteen of march last year ] was a welcome step forward but not enough given the current situation @ today ] the cultural religious and economic damage inflicted on the turkey mepopulation is still highly visible and cannot be ignored by the % european union ] we should not forget all the incidents
bending conditions
@ over many years ] the agency has demonstrated this capacity to provide elucation health relieved and social services
the other one the ) european defence fund ]
the % european union ] is known as a soft power and this identity should be preserved and developed this
i would like to stress that the intention to have more than ( eur five billion ] * europe ] a year for this fund request on resources for the % european union ]
corruption is not just a private matter that is why we have to push governments and political and social bodies to fight for themselves against the internal structural corruption
things are not in line with those high standards in some or many of a member states women do not know how many
and it is really very difficult to come into the solution without knowing where these borders and what are the guarantees to ourselves border to national security areas so that we really can say our citizens yes we have the high standards
we much commission and the ` council ] to provide us with this kind of clear knowledge what we mean by national security
we should continue to invest our efforts to guarantee the implementation of the existing tools and the full use of % eu ] and indicated to the fight against cyber streads
but we should also continue an intensify work to provide for new and more comprehensive responses to the consently of overwing challenges posed by this threat
the ` council ] who remains fully committed to war constictively towards adoption and effective implementation of concrete measures in that respect
@ today ] the presidency and the ` european parliament ] received key imput from the commendations for the most challenging issues in the directive regarding scope and several aspects of implementation that real being straining strong
with this directive the % eu ] is going into uncharged territory in attempting to make our new digital lives more safe and secure
this is admittably not an easy process as developing legislation on a highly technical issue the touch at the same time on national security is no easy task the & latin presidency ] continues and will continue to work to make significant progress on this file by the end of join
we shall also continue our efforts towards introducing effective and creative practical preventive and countermeasures that will go beyond the necessary legislative minimum
dramatic changes in the * median ] scape in particular the introduction of new technologies have resulted in an unprecedented flow of him of information
despite the economian measures nisa total terrial regimes nor terrorists are able to firmly close the tep and fully prevent the information flow
media serves as a caterolist for a rapid and effective global response and thus is which was a survival of a democratic society
mr president i would like to say to thank you to all the shadow up atters because this negotiation procedure has not been a traditional i want this you want that let us meet in the * middle middle middle middle middle moment ]
this report will then have a financial instrument that will make it profitable for ship owners to scrap their ships legally
there has been a massive lawbying campaign against this proposal by the ports but it is actually based on incorrect information
the money collected will go back to the sector if they follow the law
they have been warning against huge administrative burdens why the impact assessment said that it is a very efficient administer } today ] to deal with this problem
so please support these financial instruments amendment ! thirty one ] and ! thirty two ] so we can negotiate with the ` council ] who stands ready to negotiate with us
this will require proactive interventions by member state governments
free market theology must not stand in the way of doing right by workers
so is the common refrain that we must learn the lessons of this economic crisis genuine
if it is then the case for fundamental change in % eu ] policy and indeed % eu ] treaties is now unanswerable and should be the stop of % eu ] council deliberations
we need a new treaty for a new time
so i call upon the ` council ] to act according to legislation according to the mocracy
mr president new technologies are rapidly changing the nature of the financial interest
this presents massive opportunities for * europe ] and it is now up to us policy makers to make the right choices and create a conducive environment so that * europe ] can benefit to the full extent
financial is often used to refer to a specific seen of start offs disrupting finance with innovation
this definition is not a one used in our report because it would exclude a large amount of relevant actors
instead financing maybe understood as finance enabled by new technologies covering the whole range of financial services products and infrastructure
it also includes intertech the use of new technologies in ensurance and ratack the application of new technologies for regulatory compliance the current rise of financial comes at the origination of a number of different technological developments within a short time spend
namely artificial intelligence cloud computing and disrebuted legislation technology
these provide new opportunities for disruptions like mobal payments open banking crowed funding cripped up currencies and robe of advice
financic can lead to significant benefits such as cost reductions efficiency gains and more transparency
it can be also an effective tool for financial inclusion opening up high level services for those that could not afford them before
furthermore financial can enable cross border financial floors and infrastructure through alternative lending and investment channels
the financial revolution that we are currently experiencing is global
the bulk of these investments was made in the % united states ] and also ` israel ] are gearing up in this respect
the % us ] china and % israel ] has more than ! half ] of the top ten largest financial companies
if * europe ] once to remain competitive rapid innovation should be a norm not the exception
this is not only important for ) europe ] 's financial infrastructure but also for the real economy with consumers and businesses benefiting from improved financial services
not withstanding all the benefits financial also confronts us with essential questions of a regulatory society nature
consumer protection and the stability of the financial system should be key concerns in this regard
together with the competitiveness of the ` european economy ] they make for the core priorities of this report
the report does not intend to give technical solutions
however it does intend to pose the right questions
that should be a first step in the process of creating a forward looking ) european ] policy in the area of financial tychnologies
the intention of this report is not to propose specific legislative actions
we must be cautious with creating new rules because much is still unclear about future developments of financial technologies
the better point of departure is investigating where current legislation causes uncertainties or barriers and identifying where additional action is necessary
doing this purposefully requires a holistic approach as technological developments in our digitising society call for breaking cyllers
financial already breaking sidelows themselves
often they offer products in a diverse multiparty conjunction
i have some minutes left at the end i will use the time then
we are to go on with any kind of digital services we have to have very strong common simple understandable data protection regulation
i very much hope that in cooperation between the commission and ` parliament ] we can make also clear to ` council ] that the package of data protection is crucial for development of digital single market
roma people have been suffering all through the ) european ] history but also the situation has never been better
they will have an opportunity to give prosperity to all of the people of * europe ]
that in your reply and do not continue to attack the people that are moving pross borders
with the implementation of a harmonised ) european ] approach making these websites accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable business
the directive now covers all % eu ] public sectors bodies websites and websites providing public services as laid down in a new ) annex ]
this directive is essentially a forerunner in the plant ) european ] excessibility act which i know is also being eagerly awaited by our citizens
the specifications for the accessibility are technology neutral and based on the international weap content accessibility guidelines
in our increasing the ditical world accessibility is very much a human right all people are entitled to use the internet in order to exercise their fundamental rights and
less than ! one ] ! third ] of europe 's public sector and government websites and even as then ! ten ] of * europe ] 's websites in general are fully accessible
however despite the fact that assistant technology already exists * europe ] has been legging far behind
in * europe ] this amounts to ( eighty million ] citizens with disabilities and ! another eighty seven million ] aged over ! sixty five one hundred and sixty seven million ] ) european ] citizens is too great a number to be ignored throughout my involvement with % stosia ] i have seen what these people face when trying to navigate their way online it was particularly
we are the % european union ] we should be setting the agenda not struggling or even fading keep to keep up
making websites and their content usable for all should have already become a priority at % eu ] level
this piece of legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited by both citizens with disabilities and our increasing ageing population which find themselves more isolated and excluded from a world when information is accessible primarily online
the intercommittee was more ambitious and made a number of significant amendments to the text
i am sure the ) greek ] presidency will follow up the good work on this file it is completely feasible that the ) european presidency ] will be able to bring this dossier into legislation
the scope along with the enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems reflects the binding obligations set out in the % un ] on the rights of persons with disabilities and the commitments made in the digital agenda for * europe ]
the financial benefits are currently estimated at ! two billion ]
however i thank commissioner } cou ] for having openly supported our legislative work using one of the most modern ways of rapid communication towards
however this is only the ~ first ] step in the legislative process we regret the lack of engagement of previous presidencies on this dossier
it is both an ethnically shoe and a commercial issue
it is about basic and fundamental human rights and it is about jobs
in the speech you said that @ after a year of work ] in another country the country in which @ africa ] worker had worked should be financially responsible for the payment of unemployment benefits
the guiding principle behind this is that a fronture worker should receive benefits from the country in which he ossi has contributed
this is fair for everybody you said
i completely agree with this principle therefore commissioner i would like to ask you to night if you think that this principle that a person should receive benefits from the country in which her she has contributed should apply for not only frontry workers but all mobile workers within the % eu ] thank you
mr president you mentioned that there are differences between the countries in * us ] and employment
the aim is to undermine the work of legislators such as us and at the same time misleased consumers
leaving ( millions ] of fraudlent cards on our roads more than @ two years ] after the deal gates scandal and our committee work in this ` parliament ]
in our economy mrs commissioner and in our society no private company no sector they may be the largest they may have a lot of people working there but none of them should be allowed to be to be to act as they do today as they car industry does today because they should be
they would follow your order and receive migrants and refugees in my country hungary you as well as every single person in this room no perfectly well that those people would not want to stay in hongery because they want a better life
what is the order so to say in this respect
we all know very well that we cannot put these people into like close institutions
they have the right to freedom of movement
i know we should integrate them
mr president this is the role gance and mr } time amands ] and the equality because they would not like to be integrated in hongery they would like to move on the next day to reach your countries so you must have a strategy about the treatment of the migrant crisis
we are in opposition to pledge ) european ] government more to open up
implementation and enforcement are fundamental for our future
a good application of % us ] vasic in order to regain the support of our citizens and increase the efficiency of our monetary % union ]
we are talking about more integration
there are ! two thousand and eleven ] energy port on iceland clearly demonstrates ) iceland ] advanced level of preparation the closure of @ eight ] negotiationship this is most welcome by the challenging miss } negotiations ] are yet to come and i am in here chapter such aspicious negotiations are yet to
greater importance should also be given to negotiations on chapters such as original policy the environment and the economic and monetary policy i saw that according to the recent pollen the majority of icelanders still opposed % eu ] membership since @ sixty seven ] are against and only @ thirty three ] in @ favour of ] accession but
the legislator defined both manutary information and voluntary information for consumers making information acrossial point of the legislation
it is critical that consumers have access to complete information in order to make an informed choice
the resolution of the fisheries committee discusses the commission 's arby from control of @ two thousand and fifteen ] which analyses the conformity of labelling with the legal requirements of wide fishing retail
however numbers are worrying for some species for which the level of conformity is very low common species are substituted for more expensive species
it could help in the creation of an external structure which scrutinises the certific cohesion of voluntary claims including on the label afficiary and acricultural products
i would also like to remind the commission that ` parliament ] is still awaiting the commission report on the possibility to define an establish minimum criteria for the creation of an % eu ] % eu ] equal able for fisherian acriculture products
further information of fish can be added to a label as an addition to compulsory information
member states must implement sanctions which are efficient proportionate and despasive
compulsory and correct information must be available for consumers all the way through the chain including dinors and restorance
it deals with voluntary information on fishery products and aims at creating and up to date an exhaustive inventory of voluntary claims associated to the fishery and equiculture products which are marketing in the % european union ] whatever their origin
the commission is currently working on the implementation of a pilot project proposed by ` parliament ] @ last year ] and my regards to our chair vis the cadeko could not be here @ today ]
this inventory will enable an analysis of the certification systems of these claims
it is also necessary that such information be reliable meaning it must be controlled in a very strict manner
this information can able consumers to have complementary information such as the date of catch data of landing more informational fishing gear the flag state information on the national value of the product environmental ethical or social information
in a separate study from @ last year ] on @ labelling ] in % russians ] including the % eu canteens ] the ` endured ochiana ] estimates mr } labelling ] at ~ thirty two ] overall with a mislabling rate in blue fintuna to be ! eighty ] of this observation brings us to ask member states to enforce the existing law
~ first ] and @ four ] most member states have to reinforce controls in order to identify fraud and the missing links in the supply chain for fishery and agriculture products which lead to mislabelling or fraud
it is the duty of member states to guarantee that this information is available and accurate
we are waiting this external structure and hope that this information will be easily accessible to consumers
the publication of this report is a requirement of the ` common market organisation ] for fishery and acquiculture regulation
this is often the case for blue fintuna
compulsory information is the following commercial designation of species and its scientific name the production method and fishing gear the area where the product was caught or produced and the clear indication where the product was defrosted this manitory information applies both to retail and supply for cators and restorance
restrance must always keep the information which they received when they both the product in case consumers or state authorities ask for them
i think we need to promote public awareness and online safety especially among children but also with parents so that they know exactly what is going on what can be done on the internet
it is a wonderful source of information for all of us and it is going to be part of our lives into the future however there are those who pray on children and they will use the internation as much as they possibly can to try and undermine children
i think member states should work together to introduce a network of contact points for the public to reach report illegal and powerful content and conduct
if i could turn to activity based budgetary and management i and the commissioners made huge programmes on this but i would warn against overpro crisis exercise because what we want to ensure their qualitative evaluation not simply ticking boxes
it will allow us to get a much clearer idea of our policy perspectives on top of the commission 's and your work programmes
mr president out of this budget review we simply after ask ourselves ! one ] question does the budget reflect the political priorities of the @ twenty five century ] if it does not in each changing
is it flexible enough to reflect changing times
we do not want people spending all their time invaluating themselves when they should be getting on and doing some work
we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the mff
now it is about university it is about anges it is about angest national consultation
we have witnessed an attempt an attempt a vage idea to reintroduce the death penalty and all that coming from a man who is constantly referring to ) christian ] values
the only thing that comes to mind me in all this context is if all foreign influences so bad why do you accept the payment of ( eur five billion ] and the % european structural funds ] in order to plaster the whole country with the posters in which you call % brussels ] crap
somebody who does that for a minister lead the % union ] out of their own accourt
we have witnessed several unspeakably worded national consultations in the meantime
the angel think for ministers not about transparency as we all know it is in order to labour angels that are foreign funded as foreign because they might carry foreign influences to hungry and foreign influences bad
it escapes me from minister where the death penalty would be on any ) christian ] agenda and have really found any ) christian ] ) theologians ] who would have been able to find anything good about the death penalty
when the last time melion people marched through the streets of the ` european capital ] demanding more % eu ] integration
it is also a moment of trute for our policy in the eastern neighbourhood and i would day to the biggest stestiate of the % eu ] spare foremonts as a geopolitical actor capable of defending its interests and values in the immediate neighbourhood
i fully share the ` parliament ] 's sense of urgency to make progress on this proposal
i therefore welcome the proposal of the budget committee of the ` european parliament ] which proposes to restore most of the appropriations proposed by the commission in the draft budget
@ fifteen ] we cannot afford the % eu ] budget being paralised we need to bring it under control and we have at this moment a unique opportunity to do so
i fully agree that we must act responsibly and address at this stage the need that we have in payments
however even if indeed further reinforcement contribute in increasing investments we should try and find the right balance with the implementation prospects and depayments of airline
we should seize such a portunity to address the shortage of payments appropriations
all this has to be achieved within a very tight financial circumstances and very tied budgetary seelings
we must also honour our obligations and pay of standing bills steaming from past commitments thus avoiding unnecessary burden on beneficiaries
sustainable economic growth competitiveness the creation of jobs and the fight against use on employment are overarching priorities of the % eu ] policy and should be reflected in the orientation of the % eu ] expenditure for @ two thousand and fifteen ] we must do this under a clear and agreed framework and provide a necessary preductability and security for our investments and our partners
i must put all our efforts in making this framework for the operational for the respecting all the terms of this agreement
@ two thousand and fifteen ] @ last month ] i expressed before this house the commission 's concerned about the position taken by the ` council ] in its reading of the budget @ two thousand and fifteen ] the @ budget ]
the acceptional additional revenue from fine streaming from the enforcement of the competition policy means that the additional payment requests for @ two thousand and fourteen ] will be in total at no cost for member state
the level of payment appropriations remains the permanent concern that we need to address at this positive conciliation we must ensure that the legal obligations arising in @ two thousand and fifteen ] are met and put a stop to the snowboll effect of shifting and ever increasing amount of unpaid views into future years
we must avoid our tefficial under budgeting in the future as we are now aware of the problems that such an approach bring 's
the reinforcement of payment appropriations proposed by the commission is proposed by the commission in @ amending leberal letter @ number one ] going the same direction as a number of amendments proposed by the ` european parliament ] where the needs are most pressing and imparticular with the aim of producing the backlock of anti debate laws and allow the proper lounching of the new programmes
in its draft budget the commission has proposed to use the full amount of payment appropriations under the * mff ] saling for to
as you know favourable developments on the revenue side in @ two thousand and fourteen ] providing a portunity to find agreement in this direction
i have in mind for examples of % eu ] covenant of mayors which has been contributed to our climate and energy objectives
this is indeed where regions and cities should be when it comes to finding solutions for climate agenda mitigation and adoptation they have proved to be ambitious for our looking and enovative so we need all of them on board
there will be no place for business as usual
i think it is very important
adoption is a wonderful alternative for otherwise on wanted children or a child that left in an unsafe environment
but what concerns me about this report is that it is another power group vibrussels over the jurisdiction of family law
in the % uk ] there are strict laws about family courts including the privacy of proceedings for what is and always will be a very emotive subject
but what i fear with this latest demand for more * europe ] is the best interests of the child may be put second to the % eu ] 's desire for more and more power
and what happens if it is a dispute to adoption
if the grand parents want to adopt
one parent is actually fighting the case
however that work if the child is taken across another country 's border another coulture or maybe where the child will be brought up speaking a different language
i believe that we all should be encouraging families to be strong and cohesive units which is the best environment for bringing up a child short
much more important point is just witness the political maddling in the brexit process or a number of ) european ] general elections so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider and this is not an issue for natives
the report makes reference and emphasises rightly and the security defence and political chamlenge that % russia ] provides for the % european union ]
much as i would like to avoid this we cannot simply support this fight as it stands now
it is an obligation for bilateral individual response but we member state
it is very much in very much
i do not think i need to remind my honourable colleagues that that particular article is not traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response
but they will do so only when ) ukrainians ] managed to fail to your greet and outstanding condition
i believe that our common goal is to help % ukraine ] but it is true that we need to closely follow this into wish
a step into the right direction is the adoption of the law on high and the corruption court this last week ]
@ two thousand and fourteen ] this time the commission proposes ! one billion ] to be dispursed as medium and long term loans
~ third ] to reform process which has been important but is not really steaded until now
therefore it is crucial that a ! two ] unfailed anti corruption measures will be part of the new conditions
this memorandum sets out the supporting policy measures which are conditional for the dispursements of the funds
tell being set to address any dobs that may arise during @ this debate ] efsi is not an unconditional support
~ first ] to worse enconflict and casualities into east of % ukraine ] and to halter every socioeconomic consequences of disaggression
~ secondly ] to the economic recovery which remains fragile
if corruption is not addressed dressed dressed dressed dressed and my fair fund should not be delivered to % ukraine ]
in that context i would like to i like ! three ] elements
there are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve to the economic civilisation and to the support of the reforms no it is very important to remind that the commission council to last term conditions were not fulfilled
in addition to newly adopted law was signed @ yesterday ] by the president of % ukraine ] are well it come to rapporteur where it comes this news with great satisfaction it means that ) ukrainean ] stake to commit member seriously
the assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in % ukraine ] which is done by your creaning wister ) ukraine ] and authorities a memorandum of understanding
hence conneed for support to these reforms into contexts where many interests can play against especially in a pre election @ years ]
in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation this is to fort time that the commission proposals and mff aim since the beginning of toward in
if we are serious about our goal we cannot slow down to procedure
i am very grateful that we are where we are now indeed % ukraine ] needs this the port and it deserves this report and i think it is very appropriate to have this next programme now
it is not included in the % eu ] although it is not included in the joint declaration you explicitly refer to that because that it is what it is also about
we need to be very clear in this regard
however the attunity crucial issue remains that of the implementation
mr president you cannot share your money and spend it you cannot have your kick and ait it you cannot pretend to be a nation when you are
the % european union ] despite what it likes to think is not a nation
it follows that it cannot be and should not be a party to such international agreements this want and many others
happily we have the perfect opportunity to play it and play it repeatedly
we the % united kingdom ] are permanent members of the % united nations security council ] we must not give this quite crunched countries that we must stand to make better use of it
this means you have all the cards block and even vator behaviour on international trades conventions and agreements which are against our interest there is a clear % uk ] message here for the % european union ] you think you have had all the cards
you do not do this
our handes potentially are lot better than you understand
what the % uk ] has to do however is to understand itself how good our handays and then be prepared to use it
if the ) british ] government is worth anything at all those who play hard both us should and i hope will find that we can play hard both them
it could form the blue print for radical change yet without decreasing funding going to new member states i have called for the % uk ] government to include these open * europe ] proposals in their reform and renegotiation discussions we are talking about a ~ third ] of the % eu ] 's total budget
quite difficult to explain briefly but it is about not shuffling money around from ! one ] country to another and not particularly that large ) gire ] recipient countries give money to the commission that the commission then gives them back and tells them what to do
rather it is focusing on countries like yours and situations like yours so that cohesion achieves sustainable economic growth and left people out of that situation for the benefit of everybody within the % eu ] on a limited basis not forever
it will be an unnecessary collection of much of information about travellers who are completely innocent
we have to delay the data after the excert unless there is the risk of the suspicion so what we expect from the ) canadian ] authorities with regard to our citizens we should also respect with regard to citizens of addressert countries % lacanada ]
we are not fixhing the system which is not working because some of the member states authorities are not sorrowly working with the system feeding into information to the system some of the autoborders
we have to check the passports and that is exactly what we are doing
you do not get track of any vis oversight in the % european union ]
stop bashing hongery stop preaching us about solidarity and talk about solidarity to those strong healthy young ) syrian ] and other men who should go home and rebuild their countries
but at the same time you know that people are tired of words and promises and its time for action from the commission as well and the strongest tool which you possesses a commission is the project the draft of your budget for the next multiannual financial framework we should stop thinking how to reduce the ) european ] budget
a look at look for own resources
we should really focus on political priorities and the measure priority is howed to move from * europe ] of divergence in equalities towards * europe ] of convergence and strong economic growth and social justice
this means that lifefall people in * europe ] is better and this is what people expected from us
i agree and i appreciated it
in some cases a strategicative legality would only be a starting point the ~ first ] measure included in the dealings and procedure
~ firstly ] i would like to refer to the due dealings in this approach which is more comprehensive than just a set difficult of legality
when the risk assessment has soon that the country for its impresents higher risk of administrative corruption or in countries where enforcement of national rules is weak additional guarantees are necessary to underpin decentified legality
the principle of good deligence reflects the legal obligation of a proactive behaviour to accept and legality needs to be demonstrated on a basis of comprehensive measures which will enable legality to be resonable assured
we should keep in mind the patterns of topical differentation are the result of the interaction of a number of different factors which vary in importance in different locations
in the % european union ] we understand that % guerkin ] on the coherence of our policies must go handing and with supporting countries in their efforts to strengthen national and local institutions and make progress towards effective governance and usual forests resources i would like to thank again
i am encouraging the ` parliament ] while endorsing the approach of the commission wants to reinforce it further and has made amendments to this end
i also want to assure you that the commission will give careful consideration to the amendments of the proposed regulation
this is what they meant
moreover will investigate any barriers that may prevent consumers from such into better offers
the % eu ] also single market for the deal financial services which can rely on innovative solution is very welcome
a high level of embironmental production is of course of the highest priority for the commission
the development countries have delivered the we asked them for a roadmap to a legal binding global agreement
i think that when it comes to such sensitive topics we cannot afford to classify them into strict categories such as % eu ] internal and % eu ] external issues because terrorists actions might be plent outside the % eu ] but can seriously affect the people living inside the % eu ]
you are potfolio no poverty reducing an equality decent work
so let me conclude
for the future of our planet and for the future of our planet and for the future of our people
and you could say well in time to fake news it is good to have that
therefore reaching the sustainable development goals within the % eu ] is vital
it says that we are making progress we are moving in the right direction
mr president international energy agency just recently publish the report saying that the developed countries of this world the industrialised countries have about @ five years ] to change fundamentally they wait a produce energy and they wait a consume energy
in order for us to stay below a ! two ] degree increase in temperature
now if we do not stay below % two ] to % greece ] we know what would happen
then if we look at what has actually now been pledged by the same countries the countries that need to change fundamentally within @ five years ] it is unfortunately very very dissatisfying
we see a situation now we are pledged about ! half ] of what we need in order to reach our tacket
we all know that we will not get a full legally binding agreement which regards some education in % durban ] that will solve these problems but we know also that we have possibilities to pursue tackets that are ambitious none the less tackets that will get at us closer to our final goal
this is why we have a moral obligation to help them financially
the fact that that is colder here now is also quite predictable because if the golf stream is pressed down by melt water from the arctic this is an explainable effect
i have had to do with a very important argument on democracy
capatash goals problems inside member states in national transport
now we are limiting its to @ two days ] for member state and it will be posing from the one nobodic driving driving drivers have a new horito go back home by the end of @ maximum three ] weeks
there are ending drivers misuses and labour books companies
for the ~ first ] time common strong enforcement is possible by using the latest econology available in @ eastern efsi national transport ] is posting from their one colleague wating against can go back home and their trivers that industrial salaries anymore instead they could be paid
if i know governments for destination meeting in ways
this is too vice weight
you need to understand what it means through the universally applicated collective agreements if you oppose the mandate
minimum greaties might begun a new norm and used to all be aware of that
currently we do not have a common % eu ] minimum weights level in transport and the posing of trivers directive is not the right to do that
it is totally unother of this gossin
we need a reach content of information and to facilitate access to information which could improve our lives and lead to concrete economic growth
we should have a better guarantee and have a better look on the additionality
there we have to support these countries to have a better capacity to take it up quality to make projects and investment banks as my colleague said
i have had to do with a very important argument on democracy
all extential societies is no longer just added to the issue or political women
this should be immediately in a conditional release on humanitarian agreements
it is now a matter of human completion
capatash goals problems inside member states in national transport
we are all meeting each ! two ] days for member states and it will be posing from the one
nomodic driving drivers have a new horito to go back home by the end of maximum > three ] beeks
we are ending drivers misuse and let the books companies
for the ~ first ] time common strong enforcement is possible by using the latest econology available
if it is not an international transport is posting from the ` one ] colleague wating against can go back home and their drivers that interviews they might not drive better national salaries anymore instead they could be paid for a final country destination meaning and wait
this is too wise to wait
you need to understand what it means to the universally applicate collective agreements if you oppose the mandate
minimum greaties might begun a new norm and we should all be aware of that
currently we do not have a common % eu ] ) minimum ] waits level in transport and the posing of trivers directive is not the right to do that
} dath negatia ] was known internationally was known globally for a fight against corruption and she reported on the corruption
multi ease jographically and historically ! one ] of the gates and ! one ] of the targs of the % european union ]
she reported on the ) panama ] papers and we have seen we have heard and we could not ignore panama papers are directly implementated with & sam multi ] 's authorities
it should be the basic of the protection of human rights rule of law independence of judicial power and in past area of criminal prosecution
to the commission and to the * maltese ] authorities is to grant respect and observation of the rule of law
but the similar concern and wish for dialogue in the election to speng he is not shown by the ) european ] introdutions in spite of having deal more than strong signals of breaches of the rule of law of democracy and fundamental rights
point ! five ] expresses confirms about the rule of law democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of the media independence of the police in judiciary
this is government is impresion that the other half inexile
i am ashamed and we all should be ashamed because we thought this killing we would never know here what happens in % malta ] journalists being aras denounced and even guilt media houses being blackmailed by bank suspected of money laundering and tax evasion
high government officials suspected of being implicated also in the same operations and police authorities refusing to investigate those allegations because they have been appointed by and half economic and personal tights with the government
we cannot remain silent so @ today ] we ask for ! three ] concrete actions ~ first ] we want the commission to immediately launch a rule of law dialogue with % malta ]
~ second ] we want the maltese authorities to investigate and to persecute many levering no matter the names or the avanisations implicated
@ third ] we want an independent and international investigation into the killing of definite guarantee guality we have to say low and clear that ) europe ] values and principles are much more important than many
* europe ] is about justice about separation of powers and about rule of law
they know that
* europe ] is also about freedom transparency and truth
the legislation to implement beyond our has been submitted to our ` parliament ] and is being discussed in our house
the texation is a key element of the political systems and our democracies and in a treaty therefore part and i believe rightly so part of the member states competences
we have to work on this
i did not mention it in my speech but the same work in the same work in the same type of circumstances is at the corner of the belief of the discovernment
there can be no doubt and i am happy that i know that a whole commission is behind us
may may not for you personally but this is happening at a moment
yes we are voting on new alliances within the % eu ]
thanks to the few markets ! eur one hundreds of millions ] of people in the @ last ten fifty years ] have been lifted out of poverty worldwide
we are gradical reform
our defence at this crucial to be keep the dialogue was united states going even if within that family relationship we have some serious quarals at the moment
we have to do this collective
many cases as we all know } deforement ] 's disagree and that health to debate also in those areas
you have this big house here
union and i am absolutely convinced that in those days she will fully agree with what i have just stated
~ secondly ] on migration i hear @ today ] reach out my hands to italy because i know they have to deal with an extremely difficult situation
thank you for participating in this debate
i am absolutely convinced that we cannot just say that our new tasks which have to be funded and at the same time we cannot find safings in the existing budgets and that is the ple i am making here there is exactly what all the member states have to
i cannot answer all of them but i have tried to bring them back to basically for key issues
this is also my answer to mr } bashir ] on this issue better guarding our borders and working on better return mechanisms for rejected autonom seekers
but i also eagerly await the italian governments national measures because they have to do a lot to better manage the influe of illegal migrants and then they know that they stand ready to show solidarity and also as a % european union ] to work collectively to come
i believe social affairs have to state that the national level but when social affairs have a cross border impact then also * europe ] need to get involved
we also have to remain focus and this is crucial on structural reforms
that is the ` council ] fingers not at those who act like the new government in % spain ] but to those who do not act
number to the question cannot be externalised and the answer cannot be simply repressed
it will be holistic and preventive
but then you have to explain us how these is competible this guient external % european union ] with an internal dwarf % european union ]
this is not sustainable
and let me put a final question do you really believe that ! one ] of % burthard ] ! one ] of ` gdp ] is the fast track the beak way for the big government of ) european ] institutions
please be reasonable
! eight ] of all the new jobs in the % european union ] have been created by smes and my own constituency of doubling about ! four hundred ] ! zero ] people are employed by about ! one hundred ] ! zero ] companies in the smes sector
we have at the moment is about jobs jobs jobs and we must bend over backwards to try to protect existing employment and hopefully in the years ahead trying to reate new jobs
that is absolutely essential for all of us
if we want to get our small businesses and get employment to stabilise in the % european union ] and in our each individual member states we must do everything we possibly can to try and save them
must do all we possibly can at the moment to support these companies in difficult times
the sectors most affected are mining extractive industries agree business who through electoric demts and water rights and logging
@ two thousand and fifteen ] in @ two thousand and sixteen ] there were around ! four ] murders polleague and this murderous strength went on in this year
the % eu ] and its member states are clearly not doing enough to ensure cooperate accountability and legal redress
this annual report concludes includes strong language on the shrinking space for civil society including the call for an % eu ] monitoring mechanism for cases of violations of freedom of assembly and association
environmental human rights defend us like her and a threat when they oppose the interests of cooperations and governments
honger where one can witness cronism and its finest is a perfect example to demonstrate this problem
~ first ] introduction of targeted measures against individuals responsible for grave human rights violations and ~ second ] providing active support for ) syria ] 's society groups and defenders of human rights i have played here to extend over sympathy and support for % european union ] people who have since ended a last year
this is coming back to us after successful conclusion of the negotiations and i would like to thank the rapporteurs and the commission also for its assistance in facilitating this deal which actually put demands on facilities so that the practice known as beaching is not any more possible and that is a great step forward
when you look at the situation in % greece ] it is difficult
of course a lot of the things in that agreement between the % union ] and the member states and % turkey ] have to be dealt with and have to be elaborated on and adopted individual aspects will of course when it is legally being dealt with in with the proper institutions
the border will not be opening again
we need to work full speed on a ) european ] border guard system on a revision of doubline and on a more structural ) european ] solutions
the solution is an outline of possible solutions and it is a beginning of the implementation in the hard work that has been done and has to be done
you cannot survive being at sea so you have to engage with the other country on the other side you have to engage with countries at the other side of the external borders so agreement with % turkey ] was necessary in any case
there are things to be billar from scretch
overseeing improvements we are seeing improvements we are seeing positive effects already but we also realise that our lot has to be done
greek governments are doing what they can at to help and member states are supporting it
i part of the ` part of the dealt ] with it before was engosed doing the food supply
! one ] thing is to be clear they are only solution is to apply for asylum in % greece ] get into that system and offer themselves up for relocation
in our position not an agreement within the legal meaning of & article two hundred and eighteen ] of the treaty
it offers us new challenges more manageable than the old ones that we are to face @ last year ] but they are still challenges and they sill lead to a lot of work and the lot of improvement that we are doing on a day by day and weak by weak basis
it is fully clear that they have a right to be heart they have a right to be heart they have a right to an appeal that they are protested regularly regularly
the debt has happened and a lot of work has to be done in practice to improve and applied to the people in the reception facilities and also get this new system of readmission started
we are also combining it with getting more of a grip on who is coming to the ) european ] member states for protection and who is offered protection in the region and in % turkey ]
where debt there is a risk of other roots that we have to work hard on finding solutions to prevent those roots from leading to a large influxing member states would love issues in the most horribly put having their lives a great risk again and
we also commend the hard work being done on the ) turkishy ] for improving the situation of the refugees they harber the ` harbour millions ] there as authority lot of work but also the legal safeguards and the legal position of those people is improved by % turkey ] which helps us enormously in them making this agreement work and having a better solution than we had before
see improvements everyday but we fully realise as member states and as ` council ] that we are not area and the lot has to be done
i think that is the biggest benefit we can already see from this agreement
of course other member states have to do a lot as well as we did do a lot as well
let me say from the ` council ] perspective and the member states perspective this is not a perfect solution but it is the best solution that we can find right now
for the time being it seems to me that we are not undervised reduced this and settlement
% brexit ] is an unfortunate reality but we have to move on
we i think i should refraise that most of us believe in a future * europe ] to top hold the fundamental value of solidarity on issues like migration and in a * europe ] that strives to guarantee the safety and security of its citizens
we must use as a basic plotform the established principles respect for human rights and dignity freedom equality and rule of law
any progress registered on the future of * europe ] must be followed up and translated into action
having spent almost @ nine years ] more self in this institution i know how crucial and meaningful ` parliament ] 's continued strole and participation is in this defining moment for the future shaping of the % european project ] colleagues when we need to draw and dismomentum and colvenise and energise our forces to forget stronger better union
we believe that success belongs to dose who can harness positive forces that unite rather than divide
the current indicators show that we have once against started to reduce their successes we believe that the % union ] should be robustly positioned to shape and manage by their globalisation not merely react to it
this could pave the way for the eventual arogion of the unity
a strong euro is needed to bring about right balance in a word order which is shifting
some options to me seem to be more attractive than others and who knows there may be other options which have not yet been brought to the table
we must face up to the reality that the ) european ] 's horizons have shifted
having said that reform does not mean a whole redesign of * europe ]
we have a fregile balancing act to follow a balance between flexibility which is not so lose us to threaten the meaning of a real union and intransident regidity which would undermind the whole process of the % european project ]
we believe in creating better conditions for growth jobs and for higher living standards through the % union ] single market
these are the values that reflect the sole of the % union ] and form the court of any future * europe ]
yes we are living in times of extraordinary and predictability and it would be a big mistake to underestimate the major sedback said backs and challenges but it would be an even bigger mistake to fall into a magget negative minster and resign ourselves to doing nothing
the % european union ] is not about % brussels ] it is not about strasbourg nor is it about institutions to which many of us involved into days debate belong
never has there been a more important time for member states and institutions to remain united never has there been a crucial time for all of us to focus under big picture and shut out potentially distracting unnecessary divisive issues
nothing in common with the democracies of * europe ] and their foretake should never ever be allowed to joint the % european union ]
but they were men and women of their time as it is a treaty of its time
because what began as a noble economic plan has moved into a political monster egged on by successive euro crates who are hongry for ever more power and determined to destroy the nation state
what continues to amaze me is that you neverland
you talk about an existential crisis but you say what neighbours even more % eu ] you are fiddling whilst the treaty of rome bans so what i will say is simply this i urge you to caution when you are celebrating @ next week ] because brexit could trigger a flookage whereby all their countries leave that same treaty you are celebrating @ next week ]
to ` dovid isak ] and his family i just want to say that you have many friends in this ` parliament ] and we will not stay silent until the day dovid ` isaq ] is back home in % sweden ] in % safety ]
dreaming and peacefully acting for democracy must never be a crime
@ for nineteen years ] his wife and his children have tried to do everything they can to get human release
it is something ration arout in a world when people can be dealth and in worst cases we deprive their lives just because they dream of a better society a better world
~ first ] enforcement i want to thank on my colleagues for a good cooperation that has made this resolution possible and urgency that talks about real people 's lives because oppression and injustice are not only words
martil luther king wisely ones said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
furthermore the ` council ] } legal service ] has been requested to provide an opinion and the precedency is now waiting for this opinion before continuing the discussion
madam president honourable members i thank you very mad for giving me the opportunity to the labour on behalf of the commission a statement on the most crime project i know that this continues to be a subject to
! three ] different approaches to the mandate can be distinguished of these estates in the ` council ]
a member of tas
~ first ] there is a significant number of member states which are clearly in favour of the mandate
efficient in our our support and let me touch a couple of things the commissioner also said about it
this is a combining help and bonehend emergency as the commissioner said and prevention for the future
support for people and also for the future
there can be a combination of those ! two ]
i think the biggest thing is that we are abling things to happen
we need to share informs where we can easily share the information and also where we can share the beakdata which is very important with the ` icc ]
we understood
the most incredibly complicated time
so instead of actually blaming and criticising especially personally some people at ` ecb ] we should appreciate what they did for the way how our economy has got out of the crisis for jobs they safe ector improved a situation in * europe ]
mr president in @ may two thousand and thirteen ] ` european parliament ] voted for the single market to be perceived as a holistic unified project finding an equalibrium between an open and sme friendly economy and assidures in social and basic rights
however this proud place comes with responsibilities
the need to look further we need to address the major largely political question as well
they do not go a clobe they do not have a plan they will continue giving ( billions ] of our money to the % eu ] and are completely split whether to carry out the result of a reference or not
the stories have a great hand nearly ( eur forty billion ] pounds of the % eu ] as a punishment for having a democratic decision to lave
the stories have a too year to come up with the position on % brexit ] and show us a blue print of what an independent britain would look like
the recent commission stepment of estimates showed that the % uk ] will be handed in over
the citizens charter would clear the outline citizens rights and obligations within the single market especially for ) european ] citizens want to move sell shop and work at cross borders the agent need for such an initiative was confirmed by the commission citizens top printic concerns
the commission must now address these concerns by presenting the top ! twenty ] solutions as soon as possible to restore the crucial variable of credibility among citizens to the market
these measures would correct consumers and assemes negative perception of the single market thereby boosting their participation in the market and reassuring the citizen that the % eu ] works for them
there is no way out and if you say if he says well perhaps a month or two later i will not accept
the situation in the ` gorc ] is indeed terrible and it has been terrible for quite a while and i am deeply concerned about the handling of the current issue with regard to the casis province
prepare the elections properly
we should not accept anything unless there is really abroad consensus with all political stakeholders
i would like to see you ms } haym representative ] despise your comprehensive explanations and the commission to take on an even more prominent role
and of course we took the decision in @ september two thousand and fifteen ] for the package of ( eur one hundred and twenty million ] * euros ] and of course it was done to directly directly support farmers and to see how we can lever it
it is also clear that it should be a joint effort a joint effort by the ` council ] by the ` european parliament ] by the ` european commission ] but also by the projosa themselves
the situation in the equipultural markets in many of the member states is very difficult and severe especially in the daris sector and the ` council ] is fully aware of the situation and due charity concerns of the farmers who have to cope with these difficult problems
the ` vilbury on the agenda ] for the ` dum council ] to be discussed by the ` council ] member states and the commission
i are still implementing those measures
in market we took ! sixteen ] additional measures together with the ` european commission ] and the ` council ] and those measures relate to intervention measures to export as well as to possibility for member states to give additional state
but also in the last council it will clear that many member states have stated that if we are going to take again additional measures they have to be linked to the reduction of the mill production
you see an effort increase of the mill production of about between ! five ] and ! six ] but it is not a case in every member state so while stating that we need a ) european ] answer at the same time we need flexibility for the member states to implement measures which are suitable for the national circumstances
mr president i would like to thank all the members of parliament for their remarks but also for their suggestions and certainly the presidency will take them with us to our next discussion in the ` council of juncil ] of % juncker ]
i would like to reiterate what was said by commissioner } hoken ] that the commission and the ` council ] we are not resting on the lowers
many measures have been taken not only suptember but also in market and of course we see some effects of those measures perhaps not enough but are our effects of those measures and a situation could have been worse if we did not have taken those dose measures
and yes i would like to reiterate that we need ) european ] approach
and clear that the ` council ] also stated that we do not want to go back to a croter system and i agree with what i said by mr } haltima ] that we have to improve the situation of the farmer in the supply chain
we have to give them a fair price for the policy
therefore the work of the market doss force is told by the ` european commission ] is so important and in the ` juncker ] we will have a ~ first ] report of this tas force and hopefully we get some interesting and creative ideas
at the same time of course we have to support those farmers and to see how we can help them better than supply and in @ month ] and this
it is not the debt model of the & debt government ] but it is also the debt model of the & debt dari producers ] and they are looking into nice markets into improving quality into new market concept
it is also now at this moment discussing possibilities of reduction of the milk production in the needless on a voluntary basis nothing it is up to the ` council ] in joing to see how we can support those initiatives of farmers organisations to reduce the milk production
i believe we have come up with it good report
because the patronising attitude that we have had in the past has made us look ~ second ] or ~ third ] in line in terms of preference of many recipient states and that effects the notional validity of ` parliamentship ] was well
in ! one ] of my amendments and supported by the rapporteur refers to the effect that member states ) europol ] and ` eurojust ] are not granted the possibility to communicate data to known member states and ~ third ] countries because of the absence of sufficient data protection and those countries
in my opinion the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control services requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out analysis of the information contained in the system
the review will also increase the effectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of the customs administrations due to the joint outdomated information system that will assist in preventing investigating investigating investigating and persecuting serious contributions of financial laws
sometimes i have the feeling that a little too much of the signality energy we in the green group believe that the report is an important one the aim of it is a very legitimate and crucial one for the time
has it been about unleashing the full potential of the & lisbon treaty ] in the field of security and defence we would be in full support
it would be an agency without transparency ` parliamentary ] oversight let alone control we are in full support of centralisation it makes sense in this people but not in this way without any accountability whatsoever
~ secondly ] we believe that before committing large amounts of fresh money to the defence and execurity we should explore the full potential efficiency gains through cooperation and only after this shall be available through the % european union ] budget or from member states
these are the main reasons why our group is unable to support the report even though we are committed to a stronger ) european ] common defence in security policy and there are many very good ideas in the report in general
an aggressive fiscal plenning
they have the potential to enable us to solve many of their critical problems confronting us
in order for it to be effective bridging the legitial devide has to be mainstreamed into every other policy with the coordance with the % united nations ] systemable development goals
did you doubt the knowledges have the huge potentialist in terms of reducing poverty increasing the competitiveness of economic and creating employment opportunities
private sector needs to get involved and play rules through its expertise and innovation no
at the same time huge increase in mobil services is securing across the planet and the numbers of mobil users are now surposing the numbers of people having access to electricity sanctation or clean water
in the ` european consensus on development ] which is a crucial document on development policy of the % eu ] and its member states we can find the bold statement that they would continue to support information and communication technologies in development
we are all aware of the fact that also in this area of developing cooperation public funding will not be sufficient for a truly transformative dutilisation process
according to the @ two thousand and sixteen ] warred development report on the ` g twenty six billion ] people lack access to high speeding ternet and ! four billion ] still have no internet access at all
in order to realise these goals both developing countries and develop countries as well as all actors both public and private need to maximise and join their efforts
special attentions attention has been given to supporting digital itracy and skills to impower people especially women and people in vulnerable emerginalised situations to promote social inclusion and to facilitate their participation in democratic governance and digital economy
whereas the judication is strappingly growing globally our partners from developing countries continue to like behind losing the opportunity to fully utalise their human capital towards the achievement of the system at a development goals
at the time when judicisation is growing fast this lack of access is some major challenge to development as it continues to widen coups and inequality in the world
if this potential is to be realised then we must find ways of tarning distacknowledges into research for all people despite the challenges they face within the % eu ] communities what does it mean
for this very reason there is a need for public private cooperation based on development principles
i very much hope that we can take away the last exemption for airports and harbers and so on for using these inefficient methods that create people feeling bad
so i think this report is important
and how can you say that you will have a high level of protection when people forget seed these on caffairs with ! twenty million ] people 's date on them and when we know that how easit is to hack into computer cited myself as a kid actually
then you look at the antiterral legislation with profiling and you see it creates in security and it creates problems for people to live their daily lives and you cannot combat terrorism with anti terrorism with anti terrorism with anti terrorism and insecurity feelings
we can see it is neither efficient nor legal
the ) german surveillance ] scheme on @ eighteen two forty years old ] ) muslim men ] in % germany ] was not efficient
the ` council ] needs adapt their logic and spends the resources efficiently targeting the specific individual and focus the time on them and instead of going for ephnic registration which is in complete violation with any human rights standards
this matter is extremely important because from * europe ] we can make sure that the latest technology impacts on the usefulness the efficiency of road transport in all its forms
we need more data on the wind screens so that we can sort out our own salvations in a more effective and efficient manner
so often as elected members we journey round our constituences and find ourselves in trafficked gams and so often we have to make fown cause to find out what the situation is ahead
i wish mrs } jenson ] and i wish mrs } jenson ] and the commissioner every success
madam president i speak as a civil engineer and my son has a transport
the chineese
cell it
this is the key point where we talk about cohesion
this is exactly the moment when the government should step in and some of them do it but some of them do not
i am part from that it does not make sense to repeat wrong things it does not make them more true
we are definitely not financing military operations out of our budget in future
rightly so it remains with the national budgets and with the national governments and parliaments but we have to become more efficient
this exercise is primarily also and more efficiency exercise because if we plan together if we procure together if we train together that makes us more efficient in the tasks ahead
well in nature we could block everything if we had to lie to rely on nato any vital from any member state would definitely block our access to nato resources
we need a certain amount of strategic and operational economy as the % eu ] in order to be able to do what we deem appropriate
finally sanctions are part of the efficient % europolicies ] i propose that we should make these more efficient targeting concrete in debt responsibles for breakding international laws and human rights prioritions
protection procedures have simplified
are you like to ask the commission and the ` greek ] government to continue the implementation of the approved legislation full implementation known % eu ] law will generate convergence in the quality of reinstitutional framework with the best ) european ] countries
the late payment regulation is a case where the ` greek economy ] would have big defended to avoid future generation of non performing loans when the next crisis come
it would also be good to understand how revenues for income tax have been lower into @ thousand and seventeen ] the new thousand and sixteen even though the economy of the country is growing
during the crisis under the strategy and during the very limited time new framework including the fiscal compact that we are debating @ voscreated ]
it is not a good policy
as the ` consequence country ] soon after substantial difficulties and people have suffered
the data would observe that in * eurozone ] from @ two thousand and nine ] every year there was the client of the facility jdp
~ second ] what is the state of play on the member state competent authorities
mr president the roaming like at home rules was ! one ] of the most significant success @ tories ] of the % eu ] @ this year ]
we have to take it one step further by expanding it to the vestment barking candidate states already during the accession negotiations
this would be beneficial to the economies through market integration and better services
these include the sexual exploitations of ) syrian ] refugees by those delivering aid on behalf of the % united nations ] and other well known international organisations
several countries including the % united kingdom ] and the % netherlands ] have announced the investigations into the funding they provide to these and other international organisations and that they intend to make measures to prevent similar situations in the future
through its external financial instruments and the ` european development fund ] the % eu ] provides ( billions of euros ] in assistance to ~ third ] countries through international organisations among other channels
i therefore have a few questions for the high representative on a response from the % european union ]
~ first ] of all will the commission or the high representative order a thorough investigation to determine whether % eu ] funds have financed either directly or indirectly the organisations where sexual abuse has been established
~ secondly ] what is the response by the commission and the high representative to the abuse cases that have recently come to light
in order to combat and prevent sexual new conduct within international aid organisations is the room for guidelines within the % eu ] 's external financial instruments that would make funding strictly conditional upon respect for principles oversight guidelines accountability and regular reporting from beneficiaries on this issue
~ third ] but not least will the commission and the hiera presentative consider working with member states such as the % united kingdom ] and the % netherlands ] to set up contact points in ~ third ] countries including in crisis of abuse
they showed that with a more ambitious proposal the few will saving cost would be much bigger than the cost of a new vehicle relative cost of the increase of the new vehicle
i am prepared to pay more taxes but i have to be fair and they have to be good taxes
we had control on control sometimes five times
the aim is to perform better to show it simple rules as the commissioner said to combine furns and this is i think the need from beyond
so this is the aim
we made big steps forward and i think we made big steps forward
this is why the complement to depeat the commission is investigating other indicators including the mographic change
inclusion in any foreign spreeds resentment confrontation extremists and sometimes violence in tegration on the assart end is a promise of stability and office not to mention the economic contributions at migrants usually young people can bring to an ageing population
the more moral leadership of ) european ] important but also an example by ensuring that giving business is very important for our competitiveness
in order to hear such a global agreement in order to precide other countries and to come forward we have to keep pressing our example an example which has its moral importance
this is why it is important to keep in mind that international community will have to share those ghose costs
the report is right in saying that without the contribution of developing countries our global efforts will fail
when discussing the future actions aimed at keeping the rising lobal average temporary to below to degrees above green dust or levels we cannot ignore the fact that the least development countries are not able to cover the course of necessary investments in cleaner technologies
everybody knows that there are some pressing ) european ] issues like % brexit ] % marguation ] election in some member states but we have to take the expectations of our partners in the * vestment balkans ] most seriously otherwise we might lose them
our common vision for the future of the % eu ] has to build on our most charished essent which is our unity
if the rome declaration to be on the occasion of the ~ sixty three ] anniversary afford the % european union ] will be about the vision of the multi speed * europe ] then it will become not less than the death strategic of the % european project ]
avision for the future must not formolise the present data fosterations
the ` eight ] rules that were agreed @ seven years ago ] having on micro enterprises taken advantage of the internet to set up small businesses
i am ! one ] of his spopesmen sent you a ! tweek ] blaming the member states
so do you think that is the right attitude for the commission to take or is it in conflict with their clear aim to create a digital single market
mr president thank achieve her i suppose that now we are able to learn from history and to stop this development in terror really want to say that @ day ] after day the situation in % turkey ] is reminding me and other people of my age who have lived in % socialist ] system the days of the beginning of stale in % turkey ]
they are looking at us
of course i do understand the hardships for many ) europeans ] in this crisis
it is necessary to ensure stability and future growth
no politicians should have acted much early in preventing the crisis they failed to react in time
blaiming brussels is sadly to say a rather commonway for national politicians and some others to escape their own responsibilities
politics is about responsibility and accountability
you can see improvements now
what i am saying is that the main responsibility what happen in * europe ] is in the capitals of * europe ]
i agree with you that the defence pending is of course awful and the relationship with some of the neighbours
you look at the great challenges of * europe ] its migration and security its solidarity on the lack of solidarity and ruining inequalities
but having said that our group is also disappointed because we especially hear in ` parliament ] all of us are elected to prepare the future of * europe ] and that means getting into the concerns of * europe ] and you know very well what they are
you do not need all these ) synarias ]
it is a social pillar and of course climate change
how do we move forward
every single member every single committee and every single body of this house must be in both
that is what i thank the commission to have presented ! five ] different assinance even knowing that know of them will be fully accepted
i cannot understand it
we may have forgotten to splain that there is not an alternative to the % union ] not in the past not now and not in the future
i agree with personal juncker that the time has come to align espectation with reality
we may have forgotten where we come from
* europe ] belongs to all offers
we come from war death poverty and % hanga ] we come from lack of freedom we may have forgotten where unity is so important
this debate is necessary at the bate about future that we want for ourselves and for our children
what member states must do is to stop blaming * europe ] for what * europe ] cannot do because it does not have the tools
the question is simple how do we want to deal with those challenges
but also do we want to move forward this is a legitimate ) question ] too because i know that i want to move forward but we cannot just blaim those who do not want to go further than we are now by calling them anti ) europeans ] we all are ) europeans ]
they have to be confronted with their own responsibilities and i think that these are very important step to bring transparency and democracy and deligionacy to this process of reforming the % european union ] in the next future
that the ` epp group ] bears a proved its own strategy
we are capital framework can help us reinforce and rebuild our economies from the community upwards
the economic crisis has forced us to take a long hard look at our past economic behaviour
i sincerely hope that following on from this excent report we see significant and qualinators action action at community level to support the invaluable work that has been done and by and for micro enterprise at local and national level around the % european union ] as it is a very important part of our economy today and a very important part of our economy into the future
and addressing an approving access to micro credit offers us the opportunity to address these past mistakes
that in turn i think offers us an opportunity to learn from our past mistakes
onward going to the future i can see that city continuing to expand on the basis of these well all cated well controlled funds i would call for more involvement of the private sector in the way that the funds are allegate sector in the way that the funds are allegate sector
i would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these moneys have been to the rural areas of the * north west ] whether it is a lot of agricultural areas which are vital to the whole economy
this is a very interesting development and essential at this time in the economic situation
it must also be used to bring imprivate finance ~ thirdly ] because the different approaches from different member states we would like to have a look or whether it is feasible to have an % eu ] framework for nom bank micro finance institutions
we have to ensure that our legislation is proportional to the problems we are dealing with and particularly the ` ipp ] see that we have talked about @ today ]
it self be the biggest helpful businesses in the % european union ]
a heat of voting on the legislation on all the food we should recall the reasons for having been prudent and the ware of risks for health and wealth for of animals
we know from our past experience with the similar issues that tackle both food safety and etical relations between humans as dominant species and nature that public perception depends very much on the specific knowledge of the matter
consumers are increasingly sensitive about suffering and injurous farm animals and therefore they have right to be informed about the potential of cloaning to cause pain and to waste natural resources
yet the development of animal cloaning as a matter of food production is being pursued without public awareness
the problem with cloaning do not concern just well for our animals but also consumer confidence in food since it is believed that in * europe ] food is produced to a very high astandant
the euro barrometer study from last @ october ] documented serious public concerns in regard of capacitical future use of food products from clones this is linked to the sale of important food which could be eventually sold in * europe ] without being labelled as product from clone to animals
i therefore agree with a rapporteur 's approach urge in the commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on close
among other problems which have been covered by the amendments tabled by my political group i wish particularly support the sharing of information from animal testing so to avoid the need for new tests involving animals
so visible understandable not only among ourselves but also more and more outside
this all creates a nightmare for the budget negotiations
it is ongoing tendency to cut as much as possible without any rational and at the same time taking new obligations new commitments
we have uniques situation to solve the problem with no expenses for demembers
so the reply from the ` council ] is whether the ` council ] and the member states prefer to take this money to their own pockets and egnore the commitments they have made in the past an egnored payment they have to make or they want to really address the problem to show that the ) european ] real and pay the builds
the decision on all the whole set of her amending budgets could be made very easily
@ days ] and days trying to figure up whether the ` council ] is going to respect its commitments or not
it is created additional tentions in the budget of @ two thousand and fifty ]
we have to give it back to the member states
it is clear that we will continue to have great partners within the % united states ] even if the future government decides to stay on the side of the road
finally my last remark to this house is that there was reaction to president } tramp action ] proved that the % european union ] is on the right side of % history ]
united
as we heard a lot of her of political leaders in * europe ] say that we would keep up the engagements in the ) paris agreement ]
it is our goal
we have to add no what have been partially reopen
mr president it is positive that the % eu ] delegation in % geneva ] will give a strong priority to defend the universality of human rights against efforts from several countries to undermine this concept
more than ever it is crucial that the % eu ] 's supports the ` un human rights council ] financially and politically to ensure that it can continue to work independently
however i deeply regret that the ` council ] did not include a reference to the ` un ] binding treaty on business and human rights which is the single most important normative process currently ongoing in
the % eu ] has not been constructive in the process and hope that the % eu ] will listen to the requests by the ` european parliament ] and give its full and unconditional support to the ` un ] binding treaty process
mr president the multi 's prime minister mr } muscat ] has predicted that the number of people crossing to * europe ] will reach record level
most of these people will come from % libya ] into % italy ] via people traffickers as we know
the best way to stop these huge numbers of people illegally coming into * europe ] and to stop the large numbers of tragic deaths in the * mediterranean ] is surely to turn the boats back and process the * migrants ] off shore
that is why ! six ] ) european ] countries now have been in private talks with % australia ] asking them which way to work things out because they know that the % eu ] way is failing
only @ today ] we have been warned by the ) italian ] officials that ` gardis ] are actually plugging the gaps in funding for their actual campaign by smuggling people into * europe ] because their oil money is running out
it is good forward
we have been taking their count most if not all of concerns what have been raised by analysing the previous trade deals with other countries and i think that we can vise great confidence say that this trade deal is in many ways a golden standard for future trade deals in the world
it is not meant to do use and this is why i would like to say to those who are not listening to effects but following the alternative news and not trying to go into the depth of the analysis of this trade deal please do not bark at the wrong treaty
thank you to canada for this
it will deliver trade in goods and decrease terrorists
! first ] of all the war to defend our freedoms and our liberties
% setta ] is like a light house for these guidelines for many who are searching for evelse and trade
so from that perspective i would say that every country just like my small country } later you will benefit out of this
the ~ first ] direction is protectionism provention alism decline and building of walth
we take the direction of protectionism and closeness or we will fight for liberal democratic values for growth and for the new golden standards of international trade
it is a unique chance for the % european union ] now to take again a leading position in the global economy and global politics and in many ways devote for * setta ] will decide about this never before world needed such a strong * europe ] at this moment and it needs a guidelines for good trade
do we really want it
of course set a trade deal is not a cure a medicine for each and every decease
world is about the % european union ] which direction will take
we have been dying in the ~ second ] vote war for our freedoms and liberties and also now when the % european union ] are facing security challenges at its external borders canadians soldiers again our nor sandy beaches in * northern europe ]
jographic indications and lot of jographic indications for many other producers and of course the investment part
the ~ second ] direction is the openness to the world it is a leadership it is a effective decision making it is a growth and finally also a bringing of wealth to our % union ] and each in every nation and member state here in the % european continent ]
it will deliver additional possibilities for services
~ two thousand and sixteen ] we have been discussing in the ` european parliament ] more than ! eighteen ] times in different large groups what this trade deal really means for us
try to find other solutions for other existing problems but go forward with this deal
it is not switch out this light vote for * ceter ]
it is comprehensive that it will not solve all the problems which our workers small and medium enterprises and people are facing
the ` good single ]
because most of us believe % sita ] is good for our economy particularly for smes and it does not threaten our choices values or laws
the ` sd group ] has tabled its own consential resolution which glarifies what we mean by progressive trade agreements by spelling out clearly what we like about * cita ] and what we do not like about cita and espect to be further corrected in % syta ] where agreed or in future trade agreements more widely better provisions on sustainable development and sanctions based approach
@ two thousand and fourteen ] we have voiced concerns demanded changes and we have achieved most of those already on the occasion of what was effectively the ~ second ] conclusion of the negotiation in february
the essential group has decided to vote in favour of % sitaa ]
improved transparency for all trade agreements in future
but it is also an act of trust and an offer of partnership towards the % eu ] institutions not to be the commission and the ` council ] with which we want to work together for a better trade policy and towards canada which is a country that shares our values our objectives and our hopes for a better future
we welcome as a group of the fact that many of the citizens concerns have been addressed through the clarifications and commitments from the commission and the economian authorities through the jointed applicive instruments and the other instruments in the package % sita ] is not perfect far from it but it is an important step in the right direction and more progressive trade policy where the benefits are really spread among all citizens
! twenty four million ] ) europeans ] are unemployed ! twelve million ] ) europeans ] are long to unemployed and ( eur five million ] unemployed ) europeans ] are under the aids of
we the representatives of the people of * europe ] need to rethink labour market policies
if we want * europe ] and ) europeans ] to prosper in @ twenty first ] century we must create a competive ) european ] labour market and part of this is exactly to avoid the midst matter
too many and too strong protectionist measures have blocked initiative flexibility opportunities
this miss mess is unfortunate for many ) europeans ] whom are out of work
it is unfortunate for our societies which miss out wealth and prosperity
we need to promote flexibility
it is unfortunate for the businesses which cannot feel their vacances
in too many places in * europe ] the labour market is rigid even static
this miss mess on the ) european ] labour market causes an uncompetitive ) european ] labour market
exploisives and points
the fact is other than a small reduction over our fuel usage there is no environmental benefit
in recent ways we have seen a lot of propaganda outline in the support 's environmental tradential development fishing but the fact is little independent } non partiagent ] ) cience ] has been complated
we all want it more in real but it is not true that nothing has been acceptable
like mr } hoppen start ] this will be my last speech before this chamber after @ twenty years ]
mr president it is quite clear that some eu policies will be undermined without proper financing and therefore we are happy to support the proposal
~ secondly ] we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies because if they did they would be subject of course to the interinstitutional agreement on agencies
the budget committee recognises the importance of these proposals and the urgency
finally we would not want the budget to commit his position to being anyway undemined by the ) russia ] for these proposals
with respect to the equal pay for the same job
this house is still deliberating on the approach to be taken for the revision of this directive
mr president i agree with mr } jechanism ] that we discuss this issue in the plenary session and i thank you all colleagues and all members who brought this question it is extremely important for the consumers and for the well functioning digital single market to have a new trall independent access to search systems of air transport services
transparency and neutrality of the search of flights increased competition and made trouble within the % eu ] affordable for many ) europeans ]
we will continue discussion on this subject in our working group on the digital single market which i chair and precisely during our @ next meeting ] it will be on @ twenty second ] of @ november ] and you are all invited to join us but let us not forget that let us not the only problem that consume us encounter when booking the flight
they are often geoblocked and have to pay a higher price because of their place of residence or to put it more precisely because of the temporary location where based on their rapia dress
the consumers cannot be discriminated online and they are charies of best offers cannot be restricted by business moders
reminded us of this possibility
i think we should do more to protect local communities as well as the indeed search species in the park such as the ` mounting realists ] and our copies
@ yesterday ] the committee received a high representative right and vice president of the commission mr } mogarini ] whose threst again the link between development and security i would also like to stress here in this debate on the protection of the ` bureau ] national park the link between development equalogy and security
we call on the commission and the member states to further address the ruled courties of ant conflicts and corruption and to support sustainable development and peacebuilding strategies in the park and in the surrounding region and we also urge the commission the member states and we also urge the commission the member states to further
i recall that all exploration and exploitation are not compatible with unick world carriers states

why not % syria ]
even and that is particularly interesting when there is no essential authority in play
it would use it for deligital rights management for music fills or electronic football tickets
let me briefly explain to you what this is about
it is a lot of potential some people even like it to the kind of revolution that was sparked by the introduction of of the internet and have to say although not all my fellow rapporteurs are here we have to say all though not all fellow rapporteurs are
its vertual currences and distributed legislation technology so one would be forgiven by thinking well this is a dole and some neferous subject that will gently put us into sleep at this hour late hour of the day
what we advocate in the report is not to stifle innovation by regulating now but instead it too closely monitor what is going on by the creation of a taskforce which suggestion be created at the level of the commission and then to regulate
some of you may have wondered why is it so much cheaper to send an % email oran ] smes then to transfer funds for example from somebody working in ! one ] country and sending remittances back home because in the end this transfer fund is not much more than an electrossic phronic message even @ today ] but still it can be rather expensive
in interesting areas for government applications fighting a v fraud or using it implementative land and land register of course with such a new technology its early days
of course this technology could help us to reduce these transactions cost significantly in the long run and i think if we regulate well we might even have a open access electronic wallets where the transfer funds would be decided by some sort of leaders cost routing
we are not at a stage where and the risk that come with any such technology our systemic
but of course one would be wrong because this new technology has a lot of promise
fundamentally what necessabout this distributed legislatic knology that underlies the bit coin the most prominent versal currency is a decentralised data base that keeps a record of any sort of transaction done within that data base in a way that is surprisingly safe resilient and trust
this technology can be used indeed as the title of the national report would suggest for vertual currencies and in order to reduce the cost of financial transaction significantly
it would use it for clearing a settlement ortomatic contracts for example implementing derivatives on the distributed legislator far beyond the financial sector
i have lodged my papers with the court of ~ first ] instance so that i intend to fight a very robust case
all i would like to say is that the big fossim bother about my ` parliamentary ] assistance expenses and covered by the media over @ the last nine or twelve months ] it has been a harrowing experience
i understand i have a very good case and also along with that i have gone for intry measures which means that no money will be pable until the court has heard all the evidence and made the appropriate decision
i only heard the last ten words
for example good ability we have also succeeded in future proof in the legislation by introducing provisions on sovereign dates and smart appliances and explicitly banning the use of defit devices finally the labour will be able to swim for measure about for example good ability or rability thereby further helping consumers to safe money and at the same time consumers to safe
the close examination
focusing on energy efficiency refers where these ! four ] buildings products or in destry is more important than ever in order to ensure the security of supply and a successful energy transitions while promoting investment growth and jobs
@ two thousand and eight hundred ] people and their families are now facing serious difficulties and they are left relot any in come and even any hope
the minimum ways in itself is not the problem
some people are claiming that the ) german ] eputation of the * minimum ] ways is ! one ] of the most serious attacks on the single market since the adoption of the single market act these protectionist missus create barriers all the way down * europe ]
this is very serious and very worrying
coming from a country where the social partners are actually doing the collective bargoning i am not against ) aminimum ] ways but it is up to the partners to decide what should be the level and i would be the level
it was initially expected that ms } registered companies ] would have preformed better since the * ima ] 's environmental requirements are tougher as compared with odar and better known citificates such as i so
among them is aligning the definition of mess which i saw particularly important
now the problem is how modern technologies can be used for inveronmental protection and how industry all services should be helped in promoting the invernmental value of the production
existing voluntary and regulatory instruments were not linked to each other in order to establish synergies
mr president the ) european ] legislation was set to encourage enterprises to improve their products and attain higher standards of energy efficiency and inveronmental compliance
from path experience we know that certificates on various levels were not sufficiently coordinated
equal aboline as a part of huge action plan on sustainable production consumption and industrial policy is such a tool
~ first ] revision of the * ima scheme ] was not encouraging
the good of ecological certificates is to engage synegies with other legal acts that are tackling in oriental aspects of the products
it is about striking the balance between regulatory and market based instruments with the aim of developing voluntary standards for various products and services or helping to optimise production processes and make more effective views of resources
it would help organisation to proceed more easily from icel to imastandards
@ forty thousand and one ] yet ` ima ] 's registered companies were not performing better and the system of environmental excellence was weaker as compared with the ` iso
in partial system of certification will be we supposed appreciated also by consumers i hope that this will have organisation to choose the most rational systemic approach in order to interconnect different fields of divernmental protection
the people 's all the republic of % china ] is a global power with all its means of a centralised powerful state
what i see today when i look at hong cong is a big powerful draging trying to silence those who actually have the same dream as i had once when i started in policies @ twenty years ago ]
by imposing a squing mechanism the ) chinese ] government will disqualify candidates for the @ two thousand and seventeen ] chief executive election that do not meet the government 's approval
i am one of those who engage in politics in a real young age at @ sixteen years ] old
if we do not speak up when fundamental democratic principles are many polited then we also send another type of message we tell those students that democracy is important for us and we do not really carry if other people live in a democratic democratic society are not
mr } speaker ] there are many reports from various sources coming in on the current situation in % hong cong ] but there is clear that the authorities are trying to many polites and limits in some cases even violently the democratic process
when students peacefully protest for the democratic and indeed human rights anywhere in the world they disserved to be backed up by osceen the % european union ] as a global power of democracy
if we in this house are silence we approve of the message from the government of % china ] and that is why we have to protest and make sure that the demonstrators actually are seen and that we do not forget their deeds
~ secondly ] i do not believe on mean a scrup but i believe the % eu ] in the presence of the high representative has capacity to broke the negotiations
it is going to give the impression that is in the driving seat the sole of the problem
so we have a ) european ] economic recovery plan of which the court industry is a part
it is in reality each manufacturer is going to look at itself as best it can and each country will look at its manufacturers as best it can
there is of course a possible case for some support some financial support to the court industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact
but this can only be decided to the national level because the support from the ` european investment bank ] mentioned by mr } varhoigan ] that support can only be provided by national taxpayers but there is ! one ] thing that the % european union ] constructedly do here at least until the recession is over and that 's give
common manufacturers are break from environmental restrictions
the industry is already in serious trouble
these environmental other standard restrictions make cars more expensive
it is already a kill off and industry which is already a serious bother
in order to address concerns express by ` parliament ] the extension of the autonomous trade preferences is subject to a create respect for the essential elements of the association agreements
the uniletteral markets access guanted to equaine corresponds to the ~ first ] here of applications of the schedule of consessions negotiated under the ` d sevt fta ]
economic political security and territorial challenges i would like to thank ` parliament ] 's mr } chief ] for the efforts already made to pave the way for swift conclusion of the legislative procedure for this fine in order to ensure that trade flows are not disrupted
in addition safeguard controls are in place to prevent market distorting surges impacting adversitly on ) european ] companies and industry including the agriculture 's sector
a spart of the @ september twelve outcome ] the commission also agreed to submit a proposal to extending until the @ end of two thousand and fifteen ] the autonomous trade preferences commonly granted to a craine as they will otherwise seize to apply as of
express satis faction when the association agreement was ratified
the proposal by the commission for such delay was based on a clear request for mecraine to take an initiative that would allow a redification of the association agreements to go ahead while leaving more time to discuss ways of addressing from the implementation of the ` g third year ]
this outcome must be seen in the bigger political context
the ` common proposal ] simply extends the duration of those autonomous preferences by ! fifteen ] additional months thus maintaining the same preferences
most importantly from an economic point of view the autonomic point of view the autonomous trade preferences have very limited empact on the % eu ] markets and yet at the same time they will present a gesture of tangible economic and political support to a craine in a difficult
% eu ] fit of sanitary rules remain fully applicable to % european union ] products
let me call the basic elements of these autonomous trade preferences
we must stand shoulder crime in face of the extremely difficult political and territorial challenges it faces but also in its process of reforms and economic more organisation
delays in the extension of trade preferences should indeed be avoided and this could have an impact on economic operators decision to import goods for mucraine
even ritoractive application risks not fully repairing interferences with trade flooms and would be combating not only for the economic operators but also our competent national customs authorities
certainly not neutral when it comes to women
the ) bottomline ] has been said here over and over there has to be some stipping up over the work there has to be some binding measures
i mean i hope and expect the commission to take this on board because it also means a lot in who we are as a player on the global level
it is going to take gender quality further and social rights in % eu ] trade as if we do not do it
we decide what is monitored and when and how and
without the power to measure analyse ) utalised ] fishing data the % uk ] will still be unable to formulate its own fisheries policies and will remain under the hedgemany of the & service pay ]
this report is the ) chrozian ] horse the cooker in the next the ! fifth ] column the hidden enemy within
signal to this under the sock called great repail bill which is no such thing and the % uk ] has lost half the bouts to reclaim our own fisheries and waters before the negotiation has even begone
we have the opportunity to commissioner to take up full responsibility and ambition and take the side of ` parliament ]
our high level of ambition on renewal stakes fully into account a recent spectacle constraduction in solar penals and of shorwing
my understanding ways the during the @ market ] 's presidency during the @ last couple of two months ] there was an important shift of paradime in the whole migration and refugee issue a shift from just allowing ( eleans ] and ! millions ] of migrants coming to * europe ]
towards treating the rule of courses and treating the whole issue locally
is the policy of the % european union ] following at martis presidency this kind of paradime shift is what my country hungary has been fighting for a long time and we shall never give up
the benefits of globalisation do indeed have to reach all citizens and all communities
i strongly believe that the % eu ] can make a difference in the essential fields of labour rights and in the lamental protection amongst others and also through its deasty chapters in our ftas
in conclusion to all that work i can show the ` ppe group ] 's view that we see sanctions as a last resort mechanism and would appreciate turning towards more effective ways to deal with the problem at hand
the experience gathered so far that the global level shows that trade related sanctions fall short of delivering the desired results
we do not see conclusive evidence that sanctions could lead to an improvement of the effectiveness and implementation of the chapters
the way forward is to consolidate these chapters and to strive for the more effective and sustainable implementation of this important pillar in our valuebased great policy
! third ] being said to address any doubt that may arise during this debate emf is not an unconditional support
i believe that our common goal is to help % ukraine ] but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation
at long term blonds the assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in % ukraine ] which is done by % european union ] authorities a memorandum of understanding
this means that a rapporteur does not support any amendment to the plenary and to recommend close the file in the ~ first ] ready to end i would like to underline once again this report is just a legal basis what the ` european commission ] to dispurse the money
~ third ] to reform process which has been important but is not really steaded antilino
therefore it is crucial that a ! two ] onfailed anti corruption measures will be part of the new conditions
a step into the right direction is the adoption of the law on high and the corruption court this last week
in that context i would like to idelight ! three ] elements
if corruption is not addressed dressed dressed dressed dressed dressed dressed and my fair funds should not be delivered to % ukraine ]
in addition to newly adopted law was signed @ yesterday ] by the president of % ukraine ] are well come to rapporteur } welcomes ] this news with great satisfaction it means that ) ukrainean ] stake to commit member seriously
~ first ] to personal conflict and casual this into east of % ukraine ] and to halter every socio economic consequences of disaggression ~ second ] to the economic recovery which remains fragile
hence to need for support to these reforms into contexts where many interests can play against especially in a pre election years
but they will do so only when ) ukrainians ] managed to fulfil out the % ukraine ] and outstanding conditions
there are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve to the economic civilisation and to the support of the reforms no it is very important to remind that the commission cancelled to last transparency of the term eff
in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose economic stabilisation this is to fort time that the commission proposals and mff ii for % ukraine ] since the beginning of toward in
if we are serious about our goal we cannot slow down to procedure
this memorandum sets out to supporting policy measures which are conditional for the dispursements of the fund
i am very grateful that we are where we are now indeed % ukraine ] needs this the port and it deserves this report and i think it is very appropriate to have this next programme now
you although it is not included in the joint declaration you explicitly refer to that because that it is what it is also about
we need to be very clear in this regard
however the attunity crucial issue remains that of the implementation
we recommend taking advantage of the ) syrian ] presidency in the ` eastern partnership samid investment ] as an opportunity to improve relations with % balars ] of course as soon as all political prisoners had been released and to restart the political dialogue on inter alia democratic reforms and respect for human rights
however for vote is probably the ~ first ] time we discuss balars and its relations with the % eu ] not by reacting to their frequent negative news from this country but rather by trying to analyse the situation and thus proposed concrete policy actions
therefore we urge % bellars ] to lift any obstacles and restrictions to exercise the freedoms of association expression movement peaceful assembly thoughts for democratic opposition and g os
it is very important instrument and should be used for strengthening people 's understanding for need for reforms and for the development also of an appropriate social net
i believe that all these and other artificial barriers should be broken down as soon as possible
we recommend encouraging them by the civil society including trade unions and business representatives as well as the political opposition alongside of these officials to increase their envolvement in their dialogue on modernisation
some influential ) european ] politicians believe that % bullers ] is lost for their % eu ]
we suggest that it would be done in a very thoroughful way in order to improve their effectivenesses and adopt their scope nature and validity reacting to their developments in their country
do you really need to build a democracy in the % european union ] to have a top down elite selected and coopted by ) european ] parties or what is really very balanced put for ) european ] movements of national parties
if we are not the federation why should we have a joint constituency but not even the federations have
they must take ~ second ] place just place ! second ] friddle to the needs of our port and our board
it is obvious for everyone that the current system is unfair and has a devastating effect on honest experience including small and medium sized enterprises therefore i cannot see any reason why not to act in order to change this situation
a few weeks ago ! one ] team manner raising became the leadest to collapse after administrations could not find a buyer smaller teams and eff one are punished by rules that guarantee bigger teams prize money even if they finish last
colleagues you may think formular ! one ] is just propetual headed at % genelan jongkeys ] but actually it is important for our economy as well
@ last december ] found them the ~ first ] comprehensive into the shopping case had to close its shopping companies on website and also yelp closed ) european ] businesses
you need to show companies that they cannot be rewarded for losing them because in @ the last two years ] we will activate and behaviour has caused more than my chose to complain in companies
when it comes to % remedies ] may i suggest that all companies sit down with the ethnological experts together with the commission to try to find non discriminating future provent remedies thank you very much
let me remind you that time helps monopolies and damageous smes
mr president a dear colleague dear i representative i am looking on these issues especially as a spokes person for security and defence from the ` epp group ] and in this specific policy area it is so obvious that the % us ] is and will remain an indispensable partner
we call for a responsible engagement on key issues such as double deform and climate change to name but to
he has made no effort at all to speak with the ` efd ] as a group
mr president our group is clearly committed to term spirency and to countability especially in the use of public fund
a party represented by ! one ] mep still needs to be represented in at least a quauter of the member states in order to be resisted
we make sure that we make it more open and incrusive less for money bridgets
this is very good news as an important element of the studily success used to ensure everybody is from board
this is why we propose and hancing the coordination at all levels through the establishment of an % european union ] youth coordinator in the design of national action plans
citizens cannot go on being disillusion ! one ] summit after another
services and profisional qualifications directives consumer address and desmis incentives
lack of proper transposition and enformation potential of the digital market
otherwise for the citizen unless there is this realisation this will become nothing more than a meaning less tired buzzet
this resolution is a called for economic growth but in my opinion it is also an indication of the frustration which ` parliament ] and perhaps also decommission is experiencing the & zavid affective completion of the single market ]
we are already feeling unfortunately the effects of protectionism in various ways
however and most importantly it must be a market which is credible well understood and trusted by citizens providing ) europeans ] with a realistic and holistic action growth plan in order to achieve a truly competitive inclusive and social economy
time is raining short and continued munity and integration of the market out being seriously threatened
the real launch of the economy and the single market will need the continued importance and important and hopefully the leadership of the commission and to commit its own earship by the member states
once again we are discussing the potential of the single market but the citizen is tared of disretoric and instead once to see the realisation of this potential because the single market is very vital for a % european union ]
it would be deeply said if the @ fifth year ] of this legislature we were to find our service chairing out yet another resolution on the single market and debating the same problems that were identified in the @ first year ] amongst others defragmentation and inadequate application of rules
at this high time the ` council ] came up with more coordinated urgent specific solutions and decisions to the crisis created after all by the responsible behaviour of some banks disparliament and decommission especially commission } barnier ] have been making specific proposal and initiatives yet we seem to move very slowly
we had an ambitious and thoughtful ` parliament ]
and for the ~ first ] time we had an ambitious proposal by their commission
the late payment regulation is a case where the ` creationomy ] would have dictivensed to avoid future generation of non performing loans when the next crisis come
i would like to ask the commission and the greek government to continue the implementation of the approved legislation full implementation on % eu ] law will generate convergence in the quality of reinstitutional framework with the best ) european countries ]
it would also be good to understand how rebenues for income tax have been lower into @ thousand and seventeen ] the new thousand and sixteen even though the economy of the country is growing
the future of pollen in * europe ] state captures by a single party that is not the future
when i supported the solidarity movement in the ates that the ) polish ] communists denounced us as sknever } zahood ] as } rothern west today ] when i am ready a translation of programmes of ) europublic chievian ] radio i am getting the apprair impression that we are already closed to % sknever ] 's a hood again when we insist that the rule of law and the separation is demanded
i wonder can you explain to me how a simple law can overrule an explicit provision in the constitution with regard to the direction of the mandate of a judge in the supreme court
you were said we should listen to citizens and their concerns
for africa while you talk to us about the martial plan for * africa ] while % poland ] is a country which does have no development ministry no development agency and invest * europe ]
the aim is to perform better to show it simple rules as the commissioner said to combine funds and this is i think the need from beyond
we had control on control sometimes five times
we made big steps forward and i think we made big steps forward
this is the aim
they have not got a clobe they do not have a plan they will continue giving ( billions ] of our money to the % eu ] and it completely split whether to carry out the result of a reference or not
the ) stories ] have a great hand nearly ( eur forty billion ] pounds of the % eu ] as a punishment for having a democratic decision to lave
the stories have a too use to come up with the position on % brexit ] and show us a blue print of what an independent britain would look like
the recent commission stepment of estimates ensured that the % uk ] will be handed in over
mr president we all know that % nigeria ] is a huge country the most populated country in * africa ] and we all know that it is devastated by injustice and violence not only of religious grounds but also on social economic and political grounds
that is why it happens that % nigeria ] is ! one ] of the fire priority countries of the * migration partnership ] and in that context i myself have been a member of a delegation to % nigeria ] a number of times with some other colleagues here
migration elicit migration roots is the origin of massive and gross human rights violation aiming mostly on women and defenceless children
this resolution tackles the call on the fight on boco haram and its terrorism but also addresses the ) negotian ] authorities to reform security forces to make sure that they prevent extrated detentions are betraried detentions and torture and to reform the criminal judicial system to make sure that the criminal detentions are betrary detentions and torture
* europe ] has probably never needed solidarity and equality more than @ today ]

i can i can try but she might not like it for him
we are still optimistic about this very complicated programme and on behalf of the ` epi group ] i can say that i fully support this tend
the internal situation remains extremely complicated but we must understand that it is our shared pollen and shared responsibility
the measure problem remains national reconsidation which means serious efforts to develop inclusiveness and mutual trust
we do not even know if it is still alive
it is a tragedy that this can go on year off to year without anything his happening
this film gives additional arguments why the ` wto ] must be released immediately

the ~ united kingdom ] the ~ fifth ] largest economy in the world
we have links all over the globe to the anglish fear that the common wealth the emerging markets of the far east
i am however glad that the prime minister made it clear that we are leaving the single market
i look at interest in that the conclusions of the ` council ] meeting raised the issues of migration and security because these ! two ] issues go hands in hands as has recently been shown by the attacks on our continent
i am also concerned that there was no mention of immediate emigration controls which means that by the time we are fully out of the % eu ] on courrent trends we could have another ( million ] people coming to our country from the continent
on our dolist
it is outrised by a human security council resolution it complements the efforts of the % african union ] force

mr president a dear colleague dear high representative i am looking on these issues especially as a spokes person for security and defence from the ` epr group ] and in this specific policy area it is so obvious that the % us ] is and will remain an indispensable partner

the commission should unalise all possibilities in order to ensure that also operational programmes resubmitted after the @ deadline of two thousand and fourteen ] are taken into consideration in order to conclude the interservice consolidation by the @ end of the year ] and be treated as ready for adoption
what can be done to ensure that the revision process goes smoothly and is finalised before @ first ] of @ may two thousand and fifteen ] especified in & article nineteen of multiannual financial framework ] regulation so as to avoid losing uncommitted amounts from
but the programming stage is still far from being finalised
what is the commission 's current position regarding the treatment of commitments for operational programmes coffinanced by the ` european regional development fund ] the european social fund the ) european ] agricultural fund for the rural development and the ) european ] marie time and future respond for the * euro development ]
moreover for programmes not rady for adoption by @ thirty first ] of @ december two thousand and fourteen ] the @ two thousand and fourteen ] commitments can only be preserved by rabbiting @ uncommitted amounts ] from @ two thousand and fourteen ] in accordance with & article nineteen ] of the @ multiannual financial financial framework ] regulation
as a direct consequence there will be significant delay in the concrete start up of the project implementation
only a limited number of operational programmes have been adopted and according to the latest information available only a little bit more than ( one hundred ] programmes will be actually adopted by @ the end of this year ]
however these in place a revision of the multiannual financial framework on the basis of a commission proposal with the ` council 's agreement of end ` parliament ] 's concent
what were the main problems encountered and by which member states
however @ two thousand and fourteen ] should not be a lost year as regards investment from the ! european ] structural and investment funds in this context i would like to table the following question
@ two thousand and fourteen ] in this connection does the commission in visitating any measures to facilitate the implementation of the operational programme
reinforced the legal framework for the protection of the % union ] 's financial interest achievements significant results
it distorts the competition sometimes it helps to finance regal activities and efforts are too high it can push up the dextrate in other categories
i am gratted that important part of the proposal is simplification of the tax compliance especially for small and medium sized businesses
i believe that better collection of taxes should not be used for increasing over the government revenues
in my view money games should be invested mainly in the reduction of the public debt and the reduction of the most devastating taxes for the economic growth
i am not going to go through all the details in which we are able to support many other months of the ! three ] different ) narious ] worked out in the package
it should do the planning for forestructure and it would be better if those who do this planning would be answerable to some body possibly a parliamentary body at the same time
stand up settlers accademics and expert
we sings as a concept of public good for the ` if areas ] should be clarified as well as the potential conflict between the private nature of the ` isb ] 's standard settler and the public good nature of the ` irish ] dictions
let me focus on the main points of this report
in @ genuine two thousand and seventeen ] the commission has proposed the instrument that we are discussing @ today ] a macro financial assistant package covering approximately ! twenty five ] of cents or only a quater of the ` country 's financial needs ] is identified by the ` imf ]
if done properly it is my strong belief these reforms have a high potential systemic impact
to conclude in its current form the decision gives us the greenlight if we vote positively tomorrow for the ` africa ] moreova
has been even stronger conditionalities attached to the disbursement of each of the ! three ] installments
! sixty million ] would be alone and ! eurty million ] would be agrant to be disbursed in ! three ] installments in @ two thousand and seventeen ] ideally and in
the other ! two ] institutions have accepted ! one hundred ] of our requests the agreement reached during the trilogue also includes a joint statement by the ` european parliament ] the ` council ] and the commission recalling that the necessary pre condition for the dispressment of the assistance is the respect of effective democratic institutions
the ambitious programmes of reforms will cover financial sector governance public sector governance fight against corruption fight against money laundering energy sector reforms improvements of the business and investment climates
i have come up with this proposal to adopt this joing statement in order to address concerns of callings in this industry in the new house regarding the recent initiative by the authorities to change the electoral system in the republic of % modova ]
the principle is no reforms no money
i want to state that put a strong emphasis on the fact that the consideration by the } modovern authorities ] of the ` recommendations of the ` venezue commission ] will be part of the regular monitoring of the respect of the respect of the & affair mentioned pre condition ]
however it does not mean immediate dispursement
we have clarified that conditions are to be attached to the disbursement of each and every of the ! three ] installments that benchmarks should be clear as required by the ) european contributors ] and that the assistance should be immediately suspended or terminated if the conditions are not met
this in order to address the shortern balance of payments and fiscal bull vulnerabilities of the * modovan ] economy the proposed assistance therefore amounts to ( one hundred and million ]
these are reformed that we discipline and constrain the exercise of power by the government and any other economic oppolitical actor for generations to come
i would like ~ first ] of all to thank the commission for the very clear stands on the joint statement adopted by the ! three ] institutions and the intention stated here publicly beyond doubt to properly enforce it
order for a country to be competitive it cannot be corrupted does need to address corruption so i believe we are doing the right thing with the & dcr ] on the one hand and with properly addressing and incentivising a fight against corruption model that is not did the right thing to
i would also encourage the ) modovern ] authorities to truly reach out to the opposition and to civil society and to engage in this discussion on the if the discussion continues on the model transformation of the electoral system but i also encourage the other parties to accept the invitation for dialogue
a depoper democracy requires loyal democrats on all sides and deproper democracy
if we look at the current situation for customers no real safeguards exist against flight cancellations or delays
how do passengers really feel when they too ) iran ] air flight but they do not know whither it will ever take off and then the company playms poor planning of staff holidays it is not only the customers who are affected it is also the crume members who work on ourly great and do not get bade when flights get cancelled
what are the work of social conditions if they are only being paid for the hours you are flying with no income security when flights are cancelled
this is the model of aviation we want in * europe ] or elsewhere a new model of legal slavery
i saw him on televation
! one ] main weakness however in the commission proposal and that is that there was no provision for the setting off of tires that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date i believe that is a major flaur
her car was destroyed but she worked away relatably unheart why because the car she was drying had the most modern safety features and that enabled her not to be seriously injured
however in the current circumstance of the ` council ] given that cause are not being sold it was quite clear in the discussions we had with ` council ] that in @ fact these twelve months ] was probably unrealistic and we have to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tires
as mr } harbour ] and the commission 's pointed out simplification is part of this proposal and finally i would draw attention to what we have done in terms of demanding greater emphasis in road services in reducing noise
that is the context in which we are discussing this report
that is why i proposed to the committee and the committee accepted and amendments that said these tyres that did not meet the standards after the implementation date should be sold off after @ twelve months ]
i will bring to the attention to this house that none of those free are a woman
i think it is very strange that a commission cannot come up with ! one ] single woman that is competent for ! one ] of these authorities
it still has the ~ second ] largest military spending in the world it has a technologically advanced and innovative defence sector and we are still unable to translate these opportunities into avoirable and coherent security policy
the technological military and economic logic of a more integrated % eu ] defence policy is inescapable but the problem is exqusively political
! one ] thing he stood a difference from the other then let me tell you something that is very important
the report makes reference and emphasises rightly and the security defends and political challenges that % russia ] provides for the % european union ]
i am probably much more important just witness the political maddling in the brexit process or a number of ) european ] general elections so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider and this is not an issue for nators eastern flank this is a larger
much as i would like to avoid this we cannot simply support this fight as it stands now
it is an obligation for bilateral individual responsibility members
it is very much that it is very much
i do not think i need to remind my honourable colleagues that that particular article is not traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response
the present commission
so my last few ~ few ] seconds i would like to call upon my colleagues make sure that we deliver a broad majority for a strong proposal and do not take it appart during the vote on @ wensday ]
the % eu ] is the world 's largest provider of development and humanitarian assistance and with the adoption of a gender @ two thousand and september ] in % new york ] we all committed to the implementation of the new sustainable development goals
as the situation in * europe ] has atteriorated dramatically i think that the new sustainable development goes should take a step further and adopt strong objectives to affect the enormity of the crisis while addressing the root causes of migration in the countries of origin
we want to make sure that defends achieve the purpose to build sustainable economies health services educational facilities create jobs and give a future to people in their own countries
mr president the very development policy is key in achieving more inclusive and peaceful world by uniting global efforts to improve people 's lives worldwide and eradicate poverty
in the situation where we should raise public awareness in * europe ] on the question of the research programme and specifically of its important for jobbing growth and my question we are in the midst of the discussions now on the trilogue on that issue
following the ` arab spring ] the international shareholders of the ` bardi ] decided to increase the collabour capital so that the ` eib ] could extend its operation into countries such as % egypt ] enitially ms } president ] this dossier was considered non contriversial and the ` european council ] did not amend it
this has produced a fast stronger text which recognises the responsibility of the representatives of the % eu ] shareholding in the bank and reinforces the recents for and the direction of our involvement in this institution
about beneficiaries and impact of its financial intermediately operational furthermore as a result of the committee 's amandments the governance of the ` eib ] for the % union ] should now report annually to the ` parliament ] on the promotion of the % union ] 's objectives with regard to the % eu ] 's external action policy the % eu ]
in the resolution we also address the case of the leading civil society activists some parts on phone which disappeared in @ december ]
@ two thousand and twelve ] he was olatedly objected by the police and we are still not seeing any reaction of the last government
in compliance with the opinion from @ august two thousand and seventeen ] of the ` un working group on arbitrarities detention ] we call for their immediate and unconditional release
i do and welcome the idea of a lead state which was announced recently at
mr president vital transaction systems are constantly being improved in order to safe time and afford for users but their security is in my opinion a reason to remain vigilant
many people are easily tricked into revealing personal information ownline and into making unsecured transactions with ~ third ] parties and dities
that is why i think the most important measures that should be taken out raising user wareness regarding international actions unity
in the midst of this ` european ] debt crisis we always take the decision to fish consume more now and create that for the future
we have a very intensive ! five ] bonds behind us but i am really proud to have been a part of this process we have chived a lot together this regulation is a good example of what the % european union ] can achive if there is a political will
under the new regulation the management of the external borders of the % european union ] will be the shared responsibility of the member states in the % european union ]
! one ] of the pliorities of our agroup was to ensure that the agency has a big role in search and rescue at sea
this situation will be improved by the new regulation
~ search ] and rescue peration will be an important competent of ) european ] integrated border management
the agency starts with supporting member states in carrying out days operations
i know that the ados who have not convinced about this new agency
i share some of the concerns
this crisis has been brought about as we all know by the kind of casino capitalism crone capitalism and a financial service sustactor that has been subjected to no regulation or at last touch regulation as it is sometimes politely referred to and the follows of all of this for workers and families across * europe ] has been nothing short as we are addressing this scandal
the fact is that the % eu ] response to the financial crisis has been slowish has been minimalist
i am struck at the fact that the ) liberals ] and ) christian ] democratic groups are concerned at overprescription or that protectionism may be introduced through the backdoor
the fact is that we do in fact require a repret a protectionism and those that must be protected are workers and the real economy
we found ourselves in an ecodemic debate in a professional debate and in political debate
clear commitments regarding annual assessment of the work done by this re organisation
the public money ! forty three million ] euro will be used for cofinancing of ! three ] non profit organisations which deliver public goods the international financial reporting standards foundation which swould international reporting standards foundations
the public interests of our side board which of our seas international odate ethics and educational standards for the accounting professions the european financial reporting advisory group frag the technical advisory group and frague
it is about the quality of financial information in the decision making process
develops international financial reporting standards
the question of independence of the standard issues and the governance of this organisation
i fair respondation and i see that we will take measure for interest disclosure in order to avoid conflict of interests
and where appropriate proposals for areas regulation changes
we have now created in showing schemes and other schemes to deal with the impared assets
that * europe ] has led the way in so many other areas it is not a time to lead the way in creating the global institutions that will deal with the global problems we have and provide global solutions
that
whatever the views in this ` parliament ] i think people will go a face up to that is well the
i believe that whatever the different views expressed in this ` parliament ] there is a will across the people of this world to do that and we * europe ] can play a major } rolen ]
we have changed fundamentally and we need institutions that reflect a global economy in the way it operates and deals with the problems we have
we are domestic competition with a domestic competition
i think the ~ second ] thing that we have got to realise despite all the different political views in this ` parliament ] is that global cooperation not just in banking institutions but global cooperation in other areas and physical and monetary policy and for trade have got to be a very important part of how we approach the future
there are global problems that need global solutions
more manufacturing is being done in * asia ] than in * europe ]
other countries have now done that
we found that banks that we thought were independent were completely entangled with other banks in different countries and we have to deal with that problem
for us to sit apart to be a loof and not to cooperate with other countries is a recipe for failure and for an inability to solve a problem that is actually a global banking failure that is spread across the industrial economy
if we do not understand the problem we will not be able to understand the solution we had a power cut right across the banking system right across the world
~ first ] of all that it is important that the world comes together to deal with this crisis
whatever the party political lines that people want to adopt on this is the truth we have to deal with the problem of global banking restructuring
we capitalised our banks
we have got to do that and i believe that the lesson of this crisis is that we are now in a global economy
like or like it not the world is changing incredibly at fast
i am sure that the international monetary fund had the resources that were necessary to deal with the problems of economies that could not at the moment sustain themselves when there was a flight of capital
i think that comes out from this discussion for it for me is it to have global solutions to global problems we will also not just need our ) european ] institutions to be strong but our global institutions to be strong
more than a children } dollars ] has been spent in recapitalising banks across the world
that will require us to shape global institutions and my message to this ` parliament ] is very clear
i has asked whether the world bank and other international institutions can help countries whether it is substantial poverty being created as a result of the crisis
there is trade around the world at a speed that we have never seen before until this crisis and we have got to deal with that by creating a global trading environment which is free but also fair
this is a test of how we having over @ the last sixty years ] greated a * europe ] which has social protection as well as economic progress can help shape a world where we have economic progress environmental care and social justice at the same time
mr president all member states have very distinct legal courts
the legal system of the % uk ] is very different to the rest of continental * europe ]
a blanket policy cannot work in this % union ]
it suddens me to see this report is calling on the commission to urge member of states to ensure the strict enforcement of % eu ] rules on the free movement of persons the % eu ] cannot force an % eu ] migration policy on countries who are already dealing with very difficult internal problems such as housing and financial commitments
i also note with concern that the emphasis of this report is on bringing sovereign nations states back into line
the report 's references to ensure the % eu ] institutions themselves comply with % eu ] law could almost be a bligatory
this is not a periphery matter
this report like the % eu ] institutions themselves has failed to consider who guards the guards
this was a sign of mutual respect
your commissioner for your commitment in your @ tough tone ] which led to the ~ first ] march agreement and ` council ] situation
we have been following the developments very anciously in % brussels ] and in * europe ] and yet the % eu ] has made tremendous efforts to act as a mediator between the parties
@ last december ] only @ two months ] after the positive commission progress report we experienced a major political crisis in the former ` us ] live republic of % macedonia ] the opposition was kicked out of the plenary journalists had been expressed previously voting to place without their presence
let us continue to work hard keeping the country on the ) european trade track ]
the whole political process was disrupted due to ` parliamentary blocking ] for many weeks
this is very much deplorable but my programme is that this debate is somewhat out of the context of urgencies because at the same time we know that during this year in % iran ] ten times more people have been executed
combat and barrowing have decided to have a more authorium on executioners for the @ past six years ] and this is something encouraging
it is the only way people have to express their views about our coming projects
the commission proposal is a reinforcing directive
furthermore we ask more social assidation
i think it tells you all the need to know about the % uk ] independence party
if you want to get rid of all this problems you mention this is not the right way
it will increase cost and it will be less competitive for ) european ] market and for the smes that you believe that you are protecting
the same promise thanks to the determination and hard work of many of us will bear good fruits
i ask for your broad support in the vote tomorrow
we prove today that the % european union ] can deliver concrete results for the citizens all over * europe ] bringing positive changes in our daily lives but for the full completion of the digital single market we still need many reforms and a lot of work
we need to do our best to break down national cycle
there is no place for protectionism in our common ) european ] market
the next step we should take is harmonisation of the via tear rules we also need to unify cooperate protection rules and open up the services market in the oda visual sector
i hope that the ` council ] will help us in these efforts as for us in ` parliament ] i hope to see this project in the forefront of our agenda
already i am looking forward to the review in @ two years ] which you have just mentioned mr } vase ] president
@ two thousand and seventeen ] this forum all nabled for the ~ first ] time an exchange of use between all concerned actors such as the consumer representative in the strategies of the supply chain member states authorities and the commission some of you have called on the commission to propose a specifical legislation to propose a specifical legislation to propose a specifical legislation to propose a specifical legislation to propose a specifical legislation to propose a specifical legislation
the commission intends to provise a result of this mep for the next sharp meeting of the high level forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain on @ two thousand and june ] in line with the conclusion of the ` european council ] of ! nine and submarge ]
so far as the commission has received ! twenty one ] replies from the member states
the establishment of a simple effective and transparent evaration mechanism complementing the current schengen evaration is a most welcome initiative
burden elections will be a sensible short term compromise in such as tramatic tender offering both sides a democratic solution
the ` parliament ] electoral law resolution has been very shy a demember of the ` council ] to the principle of supsidiarity since we are dealing with % european ] elections not with local regional or national elections we are department electoral law resolution has been very shy
without showing her too ambition to adapt directoral system according to the new social and political demands for greater participation accountability and equality
we understand the urgency of producing a new law on the important subject of the * european ] elections
our electoral rules
as it is institution taking the final decision on nortification by the % union ] of any international treaty
however the quality of the ` council ] decision depends to a large extend on the quality of the proposal submitted treat
as i have said discussions on the competence is a very difficult and sensitive one
we have had several rounds of discussion in attempts to find a solution
to find ! one ] flexibility needs to be shown by everyone and i will repeat it by everyone
a measure that could significantly facilitate unbocking the situation is a legislative proposal by the commission to adopt the % eu ] legal framework to the * market treaty ahead of the ` council ] decision on the conclusion of the & market treaty ]
what would not be helpful or productive ease to suspend our discussion to start lanksly coat procedures
i will conclude by saying that the ) market treaty ] has been included in the agenda of the foreign affairs council that takes place @ monday ] @ next week ]
you should not be able to sector agenda or frame our political responses let alone frame our future you should stop putting people against each other and stop lying about migrants and refugees and should stop confuse migrants and terrorists
it is beyond all dignity and sense
smugglers access because there is a lack of legal pathways
! two ] external lice borders the way we see that some people here want to do is not to save people
more legal pathways
the problem however is that our current policy seems not to be working
these are together with % arm ] negotiation of the mff
we must try to defend it and make every effort to farther increase its effectiveness
for example in @ fat february two thousand and seventeen ] we published a staft document to express our approach
new alliances are necessary including with big consumer countries especially % china ] and with financial institutions
finally the commission raised awareness on the importance of language learning through public events like the european day of languages on @ twenty six ] of tember and the national awards of the ) european ] language label for innovative language learning projects
in highlightings a complexity brought about by language diversity and fundamental importance of language technologies on the road to achieving language equality the report provises food for thought for developing future actions
@ two years later ] @ three years later ] to see what comes out and the conclusion is clear the work fixed to work done
good results and even with more capacity to perform in the future
special times special situation each special measure
i do favour the political group and of course exactly through those seconds of the ) european social fabric ] which have been the victims of a long protracted discrimination in history of course the roman community is not only but let me say that making up the budget is not only a matter in this house of a single ) european ] political group
i wanted to tell you that in the corrent dispensation of the ` european ] budget there is a ! twenty ] or social inclusion including in the ) european ] social fund
ever since the great recession got started with socialists have fought all along the way against the recessive austerity and in favour of that ) european ] budget in order to fight so social exclusion
mr president i thank you subsidiarity and proportionately seems to be the past and president } macro ] if we let him do it so we will change the structure and the strategy and everything of the % european union ]
he wants a united states of * europe ] while we ) european ] people want a ) europe ] of nations of independent nations with suvarinity
we majority of * europe ] do not want migration
on the ! one ] side there is my country hungary but the victigaride countries representing clearly the majority of ) european ] citizens
the important thing is that they should speak up much more loudly
still if we want to protect * europe ] and our countries and our communities together hongery the fisher graft countries and the citizen re of * europe ] please speak up wherever you can and support hongery
to the time we all have come for the bank to adopt an optidate responsible taxation policy and that would involve ! three ] measures during the exercise of the banks due diligence particularly for intermediaries which as my colleague } goba ] said for a particular problem
that points which motivates many of the requests that have been made of the bank
in all of our interests for example that the physical capacity of member states has preserved and that the % eu ] 's aid policy is not undermined by tax leaking away from developing countries
~ first ] we need the bank to make use of the measures contained within the & anti money laundering directive ] and particularly to access the new registers of beneficial ownership of companies
the bank did in @ two thousand and nine ] become a pioneer when it is adopted a policy against non cooperative jurisdictions but as we all know that the policy has lost many of its teeth as those jurisdictions have creatively complied with the letter of ` oecd ] requirements rather than complying with their spirits
this makes them an indispensable sector in a stabilising ) european ] economy increaking jobs and growth in * europe ]
unfortunately the current instruments are insufficient and do not provide smes especially micro and small enterprises with the necessary means to find answer vestments
mr president for as long as i have been a member of the ` european parliament ] i have repeated a call to the ` member states ] and the commission to join their efforts and tackle the root causes of migration which is the only way forward to provide the genuine response to the migration crisis in the % eu ] and % inafrica ]
most importantly the fundamel help address the root causes of irregular migration by stabilating investments boostics are stainable growth and drap creation in ) african ] countries where most migrants come from
we have to ensure accountability transparency and proper management of funds
we have to ensure well planned investments so that the proposed ( billions ] really benefit the citizens and projects which improve education healthcare and infrastructure
of course the ` european parliament ] ` dumand ] that the commission is fully transparent in all negotiations and that we are provided with timely sectoral impact assessment
i believe that this opportunity should be used by ` parliament ] to strongly support an fta with % gapan ] for the following reasons the % european union ] and % gapan ] are industrial diants that share democratic values and together represent together representative values and together represent
the economic benefits are clear
we share similar challenges the rise of % china ] the global financial crisis decreasing the demographics the needs to access romaterials and energy sources and to achieve price the build
in addition we will support bilateral safeguard measures as was the case with the south career efsi to avoid serious injury to the sensitive sectors such as automotives all economic aviation and machinery
therefore i see great potential in food of developing trade relations with % gapan ] our ! sixth ] largest trade putter
i would like to rate a rate that notarive bureaus and public procurement are crucial areas for ) european ] businesses where gepan needs to make significant concessions
however unfortunately the practice shows that there are always companies operating within the % eu ] that will try to circumvent the rules to gain questionable advantages
they create many jobs in * europe ] and make important investments that is true
most of the years most can year
much of the credit for that goes to the rapporteur and the ` ecr ] will support this report in cleanery
i just motherhood and apple pie to use the ) american ] expression but it is of some real value
there are already countries in the process whose political systems give lesson through full throat and support to the democratic freedoms and plurarity needed for effective university sector and the admission of bellaruse would give even more cause for concern over the confidence we want to have in the process
the legacy is repression isolation and corruption and there is an expectation about the new transition government although it is chaired by a former vice president } } mugaver himself ] with % angoa ]
it is probably it is probably even a good thing that precisely at this time when we are reconsidering our strategic countries ship with * africa ] we should get the chance to prove what we can actually mean in reconstituting a democratic state in the * southern part of the ) african ] continent and in helping it along a both democratic state in the * southern part of the ) african ] continent and economically
} zimbabwe ] has them a tremendous possibilities that it could use in its relationship with * europe ]
is there any other statute
this is a disaster
has to be solved somehow
it is madam responsibility of my country } hungary ]
we are not the ones we are going to solve it we are going to continue protecting our country and protecting the schengen borders of * europe ] in accordance with our obligations
~ first ] i would like to commend your efforts to increase the overall arose safety by the initiative to include new advianced safety features into cause and trucks
~ thirdly ] and finally i do regret that your proposal for a regulation on electronic freight transport information did not come a little bit earlier in the ~ first ] nobility package because it could have served as a solid legal base for the enforcement part of the & lexb ] directive
we must make sure that they are going to be accessible to every future car owner because safety must not become a privilege of luxury car owners
but i will like to assus you mr } gigger ] what do you think will happen if countries like % sweden ] % denmark pollen ] will be outside the ` banking union ]
mr president on behalf of my group i want to request that this package of reports be struck from the agenda of this session
i think mr president that this house should show some measure of humility and some respect for the democratic process
we all know that % ireland ] has rejected the # lisbon treaty ] and so it is of some wonderment to me that this house persists in debating that matter
it is not democratically appropriate that this house would set a saudi to the veritic of % ireland ] or that this house would be used to ratious ope pressure on % ireland ] in the coming months to adopt a treaty that is clearly not in our interests or in the interests of the ) european ] people
very often in economic difficult times young people unfortunately get into drug abuse
is it possible that the ` european social fund ] could be used in a targeted way to try and help young people considering the problems that this causes not only to themselves individuals but to their communities which can have very severe effect on communities
the % eu ] is built on the nation that we are stronger together and that fundamental rights and values must never be an issue up for crime compromise
however i am worried about the current development at the same time and we see attacks on the independent media and eduptive tribe people we see attacks on women we see attacks on migrants
i welcome the new rule of law report presented @ last week ] but we need to go further
but we need to make sure to provide it with teath important measurable goals involvement of civil society and abroader scope to also include fundamental rights and democracy we must make sure that the % eu ] does not remain our @ two thousand and this report is good but we need to make sure to provide it with teath
one of the best way of providing the tycle with teath is through a stronger conditionality linked to the budget
